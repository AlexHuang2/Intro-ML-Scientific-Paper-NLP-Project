Abstract Background/objective This paper describes evidence-based strategies for the dissemination of empirically supported interventions for infant behavioral sleep problems. Methods To identify parents' needs, a survey sampled 1022 parents in the Niagara region about use of health resources, tracking occurred of public health nurses' consultations with parents about infant sleep, and nurses obtained sleep workshop evaluation data from 18 parents. A focus group with 10 participants, a survey of Niagara Region Public Health and Emergency Services (NRPH&ES) employees, and consultations with external stakeholders identified gaps in parents' and infants' care and public health nurses' training needs. We developed solutions by creating evidence-based tools and a program for parents and public health nurses. We implemented and disseminated information via sharing tools on the NRPH&ES website, and workshops for community agencies and public health nurses. Results Seventy childhood educators, support workers, and social and public health professionals attended our community workshop. Twenty-three public health nurses attended our training workshop. In guided discussion, nurses evaluated the workshop as addressing gaps in knowledge and enhancing NRPH&ES interventions to manage infants' behavioral sleep problems. Fifteen parents attended a sleep workshop pilot, with seven parents indicating a preference for follow-up telephone support. Fifty individuals attended our oral presentation at the Ontario Public Health Convention. Conclusions For next directions, community and other public health agencies want access to our tools and program components. We received a research grant to design, implement, and evaluate sharing tools and program components with community agencies (daycares and childcare centres). Highlights • Behavioral sleep problems are common during infancy. • Parents identify problems but have limited access to evidence-based care. • Public health nurses can provide evidence-based support to families. • Public health nurses can offer community agencies evidence-based resources. Keywords Pediatric Sleep Disorders Public health Insomnia 1 Introduction Sleep is an integral part of healthy development for children [1] and a significant determinant of health status that has largely been overlooked [2]. Learning to fall asleep and stay asleep (self-soothing to sleep) constitutes an important developmental milestone in early childhood, which forms a basis for development of emotional self-regulation [3,4]. Behavioral sleep problems affect approximately 30% of children [5,6], can persist into later childhood [6–8], and are linked to infants' inability to self-soothe to sleep [6]. Infant behavioral sleep problems include settling difficulties, night waking, and inadequate sleep duration [9]. Night waking and short sleep duration have been associated with a number of negative outcomes for infants and children. Scher (2005) reported that infants with higher levels of night waking and settling difficulties had significantly higher levels of behavioral difficulties [10]. Infants' night waking, based on actigraphy at 10 months of age, was associated with lower cognitive scores [10]. Hsu (2017) linked frequent infant night waking at six months of age to poorer infant health and more illness episodes at six months [11]. Short sleep duration in infancy predicted a higher propensity for obesity in high birth weight infants [12]. Infants with short nighttime sleep duration trajectories over three, six, 12, and 24 months of age had significantly lower cognitive development and language scores at two years of age [13]. Lower proportions of nighttime sleep (representing sleep consolidation) at 12 months have predicted lower levels of executive functioning for children at two [14] and four years of age [15]. Ongoing infant behavioral sleep problems can also negatively affect parental wellbeing, and quality of parent–child interactions [9]. Parents report anger, depressed mood, and distress about their children's sleep [16–18]. Their concerns about infants' behavioral sleep problems are a major reason why parents seek assistance from health care providers [9]. Although infant sleep constitutes a public health priority and behavioral sleep problems can easily be managed in community settings [19], there is a lack of accessible, accurate, and evidence-based information about infant sleep for both families and health care providers [8]. Parents' attempts to manage infants' behavioral sleep problems, without adequate education and support, undermine their success, confidence, and capacity to manage sleep problems [20]. Their likelihood of success with improving their children's sleep duration, and sleep quality is enhanced by education about sleep and professional support [20]. Unfortunately Canadian health care providers and professionals link their lack of formal training and knowledge about sleep to diminished confidence in their abilities to provide education and advice about behavioral sleep problems to parents [19,21]. Canadian health care organizational practices have failed to support provision of adequate training for care providers and funding for accessible services so that parents can prevent and manage infants' behavioral sleep problems [19]. Our paper identifies data supporting the challenges arising from gaps in parents' access to evidence-based education about prevention of and treatment for pediatric sleep disorders (infant behavioral sleep problems) in a regional Canadian public health practice setting. We use data to identify needs and gaps in care and describe tools and our program to address the needs and gaps. In addition, we explain implementation and dissemination of the program and tools and discuss our approaches, and next steps. 2 Methods and materials Our design incorporated evidence-based strategies. We underpinned approaches to managing infants' behavioral sleep problems with research findings indicating ranges of appropriate infant sleep duration at varying developmental stages [22], and ranges of longest sleep period and longest self-regulated sleep period [23,24]. We provided evidence to support behavioral interventions for pediatric insomnia, eg, bedtime routines, graduated extinction [5,25], and positive effects of behavioral sleep interventions on maternal–infant relationship quality and child wellbeing [5,26–28]. The first author, a Niagara Region Public Health and Emergency Services (NRPH&ES) manager and public health nurses, and a nursing professor collaborated with Strive Niagara (a non-profit organization that supports young parents to achieve secondary education), Healthy Babies Healthy Children (funded by the Ontario Ministry of Child and Youth Services), Infant Mental Health, Baby Friendly Initiative in Ontario (BFI-Ontario), and EarlyON Child and Family Centers in Ontario. Our partnership developed tools and a program to respond to identified needs and gaps in care, and implemented and disseminated the tools and the program. 2.1 Site Niagara Region is an Ontario municipality with a population of approximately 449,000 people [29]. Of that population there are 56,280 couples with children and 22,930 lone-parent families [30]. In 2017, there were 4,047 live births in the Niagara Region [29]. The NRPH&ES serves the entire region and delivers several family-focused programs that include prenatal support, prevention and management of postpartum depression, home visiting for at risk parents, supports for managing parenting challenges, and promotion of optimal child behavior and growth and development for children from birth to six years of age. In 2016, NRPH&ES began development of a Parenting Strategy with an overarching vision and mandate to equip all Niagara Region parents with the knowledge, skills, and resources necessary for their children and families to thrive. 2.2 Data collection NRPH&ES collected data about parents' and infants' health care needs and information about gaps in training and care through a variety of methods. 2.2.1 Parents' and infants' needs The agency sent a region-wide survey inquiring about use of public health resources to all Niagara residents in the fall of 2017. In total, 2327 participants completed the Niagara Region Survey of whom 1022 self-identified as parents. NRPH&ES also sampled parents who attended their agency offerings, eg the Well Baby Clinic. They tracked nurses' consultations with parents about sleep over three years. They also extracted data from the Public Health Call Manager Program to analyze topics for nurses' telephone interactions with clients (Parent Talk Line) and tracked calls about infant sleep over four years. The nurses identified numbers of families who accessed a parenting class related to sleep over three years. Nurses obtained sleep workshop evaluation data from 18 parent participants. 2.2.2 Gaps in programming and training NRPH&ES conducted a focus group with 10 NRPH&ES family health team members and consulted with external stakeholders, eg EarlyON (Early Ontario programs for children from birth to six years) Child and Family Center staff, childcare providers, and other public health units (n = 30) about potential gaps in programming to support families with infant behavioral sleep problems. In addition, NRPH&ES surveyed infant-child development service staff, family home visitors from the Healthy Babies/Healthy Children Program, professionals from the Child Health program, and public health nurses about evidence-based information necessary to support interventions with parents managing behavioral sleep problems. 3 Results Results from the NRPH&ES data collection provided information about parents' and infants' needs and gaps in care provision and training. 3.1 Parents' and infants' needs In preliminary NRPH&ES survey results, infant and child sleep was amongst the top six parenting challenges identified by parents (n = 1022). The top three challenges included adjustment to parenting, maternal depression, and maternal self-care. In 2017, NRPH&ES documented 137 individual parent calls focused on infants' behavioral sleep problems. Over three years, NRPH&ES identified 160 in-person consults incorporating infant sleep topics during Well Baby Clinic sessions out of 166 visits (96.4%). NRPH&ES previously offered an infant sleep class (focusing on birth to six months) for parents from their Baby Talk Series (one of a set of four postpartum parenting classes). This infant sleep class had 183 parent participants over three years. Eighteen families who had accessed their birth-to-12 month infant sleep workshop (amongst the top three workshops requested by parents) felt overloaded by the volume of sleep content, which extended from birth to one year of age. None of the parents wanted online learning about infant sleep problems; 72% of parents indicated a preference for a follow-up telephone call from the public health nurse. 3.2 Gaps in care provision and training When public health nurses who facilitated infant sleep classes attended a focus group to provide evaluation feedback, they indicated that parents wanted telephone support from nurses, individualized infant sleep plans, and succinct evidence-based information about helping babies sleep. The nurses linked information gaps for parents to their access of contradictory and non-evidence-based information about infant sleep and behavioral sleep problems, mostly from the internet (including Facebook), family, friends, and primary care providers. The public health nurses identified their need for more training about developmental changes in infant sleep and access to empirical support for behavioral sleep interventions. They indicated that a campaign was necessary to reach more parents and educate community primary care providers about sleep. The NRPH&ES staff (eg, child health nurses) responses indicated the necessity to develop more supports for parents with infant sleep concerns and questions. 3.3 Tool and program development Based on the results, a NRPH&ES Reproductive and Child Health Program public health nurse and a Child Health manager worked with the first author to incorporate elements in tools and program materials from a Canadian-based randomized controlled trial to test infant behavioral sleep interventions [16] and from other empirical sources. A nursing faculty member, who provided evidence about supporting breastfeeding, and interdisciplinary and intersectoral stakeholders (Strive Niagara, Healthy Babies Healthy Children, Infant Mental Health, BFI-Ontario, and EarlyON) critically evaluated plans to develop tools and program materials. We used a Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council Connection Grant to support the development of program materials and tools. The team negotiated tensions about co-sleeping, breastfeeding support, and use of behavioral strategies for managing infants' sleep problems [31,32]. The team members used empirical evidence to support informed parental decision-making based on a clear understanding of evidence, implications, and consequences [33]. 3.4 Implementation and dissemination of material To implement material, the team targeted families of infants from birth to six months of age and infants from six months to a year of age using separate components. For infants between zero and six months, we relayed key sleep messages (eg, infant sleep patterns, promoting good sleep habits, and answers to frequently asked questions [FAQ] about common sleep problems) on the Niagara Region Public Health and Emergency Services website (https://www.niagararegion.ca/health/parenting/infant-sleep.aspx#faq). We advertised the website and information through social media, public health programming, and community organizations. We created a tool, a double-sided birth-to-six month sleep tip sheet, for parents and put it on the website. For families with infants that were six months of age or older, the team developed a multi-component intervention program that targeted parents, health care providers, and community partners. We created a tool, a double-sided six to12-month sleep tip sheet, and a new sleep workshop to focus on six to 12-month-old infants. Other tools for parents included parent work sheets, for documenting routines over the day and detailing a sleep plan. For the program we put together a training manual, with a review of empirical information about infant sleep, care providers' answers for parents' frequently asked questions, and worksheets for providing nurses' telephone follow-up and support for families. These were introduced in the train-the-trainer workshops. Contact information for the NRPH&ES Parent Talk Line (a telephone information line staffed by public health nurses), which provides parents with additional support, is readily available from the website and products in print. To disseminate the material, we held a workshop for community stakeholders and care providers (70 early childhood educators, support workers, and social and public health professionals) and a training workshop for 23 NRPH&ES nurses. The first workshop aimed to raise stakeholders' and providers' awareness of the importance of healthy infant sleep and increase knowledge about healthy infant sleep, developmental changes in sleep, links between sleep and attachment, sleep-promoting strategies, the nature of behavioral sleep problems, ways to manage sleep problems, and implications of infant behavioral sleep problems for parents and infants. The training workshop aimed to educate public health nurses about using the materials we had developed to present workshops, provide supporting evidence for the materials, and provide procedural information for telephone assessment and support (the Parent Talk Line). We focused on strategies and tools for nurses to support families' prevention and management of infant behavioral sleep problems. A consultation between the workshop leader and a mother with a healthy older infant was role-modeled to help train the nurses to deliver information to support families. 3.5 Description of pilot outcomes We evaluated our pilot activities through a variety of approaches. Through guided discussion, the group of 23 NRPH&ES nurses indicated that the training workshop was helpful to address current gaps in nurses' knowledge about developmental changes in infant sleep and to enhance NRPH&ES’ efforts to assist parents to manage infants' behavioral sleep problems. Following the training workshop, we piloted a new sleep workshop with parents of six to 12-month-old infants. Fifteen parents attended the workshop. Parents were given time to complete a sleep plan tool with goals during the workshop and were provided with a daytime routines tracking sheet and sleep tip sheet tools. Parents could opt for telephone follow-up 1–2 weeks after the workshop by the public health nurses who had delivered the workshop. The parent and nurse jointly determined the number of follow-up calls. Seven parents indicated they wanted support and received a single telephone follow-up call. The team presented the tools and program at the Ontario Public Health Convention (TOPHC) a month following the launch of our campaign. Approximately 50 individuals signed up for our session. A number of community agencies in Niagara Region and individuals from 10 public health units have asked for access to our tools and program, and training to use them effectively. For example, one community agency has already received a presentation to staff about key messaging for infant sleep. 4 Discussion Our team addressed the lack of access to evidence-based interventions to manage behavioral sleep problems in infancy through a number of steps. In the first step, we accessed data about parents' and infants' needs for infant behavioral sleep interventions and public health and stakeholders' perspectives about gaps in programs and training. We used parent-generated data from a Niagara Region Survey and a NRPH&ES sample of parents who engaged with their programs and public health nurses. The parent data we accessed reflected similar concerns to a survey from Western Canada where 95.8% of parents rated sleep issues as a somewhat or very important topic but 40.7% identified lack of knowledge about available services and programs as a barrier to accessing information and support [34]. Similarly to our data, 62.4% of parents in Western Canada preferred to find support via public health drop-in programs and parenting classes/information sessions [34]. We also accessed data from public health nurses and community stakeholders about program gaps for families trying to manage infant behavioral sleep problems and about evidence-based information required by professionals to support interventions with parents managing behavioral sleep problems. The concerns expressed about gaps in programing and training by public health nurses and community stakeholders reflect general provider views in the literature. Canadian health care providers indicated that a lack of formal training and knowledge about sleep diminished confidence in their abilities to provide education and advice about behavioral sleep problems to parents [19,21]. A recent study of Canadian providers found that almost one-third of respondents delivered advice for behavioral sleep problems that would worsen the problem [35]. In the second step, we created a coalition of partners interested in using evidence-based approaches to behavioral sleep problems in infancy to address the gaps we had identified in care for infants and parents and training for health providers. In the methods section of the paper, we provided a fraction of the evidence supporting our evidence-based strategies in tool and program development. Research findings and systematic reviews support the efficacy of behavioral sleep interventions for older infants [5,16,25]. Our collaborative team critically engaged to develop the tools and program, while supporting informed parental decision-making. In the third step, we implemented and disseminated the material. We divided infants into two groups (zero to six months and six to 12 months). This was an important distinction because behavioral management strategies, such as controlled comforting, are suitable only for infants aged six months or older [36]. We implemented the material through the two workshops: one for community members and a training workshop for public health nurses. We disseminated the material for younger infants using the NRPH&ES website to relay key information about preventing and managing infant behavioral sleep problems. Our implementation of the infant sleep workshop for older infants included tools for families and nurses, and provided access for nurses to a training manual concisely summarizing evidence and detailed responses to frequently asked questions. Our pilot results suggest that our implementation and dissemination of our tools and program were effective. The public health nurses who received the training indicated the workshop assisted them to deal with gaps in their access to evidence. Fifteen parents attended our new sleep workshop and seven parents opted to follow-up telephone support from the public health nurse. Although we do not have evaluation data from the parents, the number of parents who sought further support suggests that they are actively engaging with the tools and information. In other studies, parents who felt they received unsatisfactory information or engagement from health care providers were unwilling to seek further help [37]. Our public health conference presentation attracted a large number of attendees. Thus far, 10 public health units in Ontario have requested access to our tools and program. Although we have been successful at reaching some parents and a number of public health units, we cannot precisely indicate numbers of families accessing our tools and program; we suggest that the number of families we are reaching is limited. A survey of parents in Western Canada found that 37% of parents identified a lack of time and 36% of parents indicated lack of childcare as barriers to accessing services and programs to manage infant behavioral sleep problems [34]. Our current approach to dissemination does not significantly reduce those barriers. In response to the limitations of our approach, NRPH&ES and the first author have identified next steps to improve access to evidence-based interventions for families with infant sleep problems and to demonstrate the impact of the interventions that we have developed. We have received a grant to design, implement, and evaluate a program to share infant sleep strategies and resources with community agencies and care providers so that they can support the parents using their services. We aim to test whether the program results in 1) more families receiving support and 2) enhanced outcomes for parents and infants who have received support. It is important to engage with community agencies, such as daycares and childcare centers, and primary care providers, such as physicians and nurse practitioners, to overcome parents' barriers to accessing help to manage infant behavioral sleep problems, such as lack of time and childcare. 5 Conclusion This paper has highlighted work being undertaken by a Canadian medium-sized regional public health unit, researchers, and community stakeholders to provide evidence-based interventions to manage infants' behavioral sleep problems and to reduce barriers to parents' efforts to manage infants' behavioral sleep problems. Increasing parents' access to evidence-based interventions in settings where they engage with their children and their children's care providers every day should assist parents to prevent and manage infant behavioral sleep problems. Our partnership, including researchers, health care providers and social service agencies, is supporting evidence-based practice changes. Our plan to demonstrate the impact of interventions on the target population is necessary to sustain resource commitments to these practice changes.

Editor: Scott Sheridan Abstract There has been considerable progress in elucidating the physical aspects of climate change that directly impact food, feed, and fiber production. However, these impact assessments rarely account for climate induced changes associated with biological pests. The lack of collaboration between the pest management and climate science disciplines could be contributing to the problem. Therefore, we assessed research-based relationships, identifying possible barriers to and gaps in successful collaboration. We developed an algorithm capable of identifying author affiliation and associated disciplines. We found that pest management and climate scientists most often authored papers in their respective disciplines (>90%), but rarely in the opposing disciplines (<1%). Atopica, an international research group, is one of the few examples of how interdisciplinary collaborations have led to the co-production of knowledge to better understand and manage a pest responding to climate change. Researcher-to-researcher relationships, as demonstrated by Atopica, are an often overlooked area of science and key to solving major societal challenges. Graphical abstract Unlabelled Image Highlights • A low number of published papers focus on both pest biology and climate change. • It is rare for individual authors to publish on both pest biology and climate change. • Few collaborative relationships exist between pest biologists and climate scientists. • The lack of collaboration is impacting our ability to solve societal problems associated with climate change and pests. Keywords Climate change Collaboration Cross-disciplinary Invasive species Monitoring Wicked problems 1 Introduction In many places around the world, variation in the length and intensity of seasons is occurring more rapidly than the average, thus impacting organisms and their management in many agricultural and forestry systems. Mismatches in growth and development of species with their environment could have major implications not only for the species themselves but entire ecosystems. For example, dairy farmers across Norway now harvest grass for winter fodder earlier than they did 20\\u202fyears ago (Mysterud et al., 2012); in southern Spain, fir trees are experiencing longer growing seasons, which could result in reduced fitness due to climate warming (Linares et al., 2012); and the full bloom date of apple and pear in South Africa has been earlier by 2\\u202fdays/decade over the past 40\\u202fyears (Grab and Craparo, 2011). Unpredictability in weather patterns (e.g., early seasonal warmth, increased rainfall/drought) can also affect pest populations and their spatiotemporal movement in the environment, which in some years can add extra stress to crops and forests already under pressure from abnormal weather conditions. For example, in forests near the Kenai Peninsula, Alaska and Kluane National Park and Reserve, Yukon Territory, the frequency of outbreaks of spruce beetles have been correlated to warming temperatures, especially during the most recent period from 1971 to 1996 (Berg et al., 2006). Weeds, insects, and diseases have always had an impact on agriculture and forestry ecosystems, but with recent changes in climate, these could become more significant (Rosenzweig et al., 2001). Many pests can proliferate under more stable conditions, and with constant variation in weather associated with climate change, they could adapt and become an even more difficult management and monitoring challenge. For example, Ziska (2001) has predicted that common cocklebur, a common weed in sorghum, will be more competitive with increasing CO2. Climate change studies have also been conducted with insects and have primarily focused on changes in abundance and change in the distribution of species (Andrew et al., 2013). Bentz et al. (2010) created population models to suggest that movement of bark beetles of conifers in western North America would be to higher latitudes and elevations as a result of climate altered temperatures, thus increasing the potential for outbreaks and associated tree mortality in the coming century. Despite how changing global climate is impacting the distribution, growth, and development of weeds, insects, and plant pathogens, climate scientists rarely work directly with pest management scientists in the various pest disciplines and vice versa. The needed expertise from the climate and pest management science fields is not always available at the same college or university, thus making cross-collaboration difficult and sometimes impossible. In other instances, time constraints or lack of resources prohibit the creation and sustaining of multi-disciplinary teams. These conditions can lead to relatively little knowledge exchange between climate scientists, who may focus on forests, agriculture, and urban ecosystems – primary locations for weeds, plant pathogens, and insects – and pest management scientists. The USDA National Institute of Food and Agriculture's Climate Resilient Land Use for Agriculture and Forestry Program funds research to enable the nation's agriculture and forest lands to adapt to current and future climate conditions (including increased droughts and other extreme events), maintain or increase production, efficiently use soil and water resources, and improve soil, water and air conditions. In 2016, a group of pest management and climate scientists convened the National Forum on Climate and Pests (NFCP) through the USDA program with the objectives of (1) learning about critical research being conducted on the effects of climate on pests, microbes, and host-pest interactions; (2) understanding the strategic consequences of potential shifts in agriculture and forestry-related land use due to climate-related pest outbreaks or reductions; and (3) developing regional frameworks to support pest management decisions that will lead to more sustainable U.S. agriculture and forestry ecosystems in changing climates (Young, 2017). To date, little has emerged from the NFCP in strategizing how to develop resilient agricultural and forest ecosystems in the face of climate-induced changes in pest distribution and severity. Nevertheless, the NFCP may serve as a model for how pest management and climate scientists can generate usable information and build partnerships (Meadow et al., 2015). What is increasingly being studied is the distribution of pests and changes in climate cycles in agricultural and forest ecosystems, and the resulting impacts on the environment, economies, and society and the need for better management and monitoring. Without coproduction of knowledge, which we describe based on the definition by Meadow et al. (2015), as the process of producing usable science through collaboration between scientists, slow progress will be made in improving understanding and generating the actionable science allowing for the creation of decision support tools for managers and effective policy for regulators. Our objective was to determine the number of collaborative relationships between pest management and climate scientists using an algorithm capable of identifying author affiliation in published literature. We hypothesized that 1) the number of articles focused on either pests or climate change are higher than for the two disciplines combined and 2) individual authors publishing on both pests and climate change is uncommon. We describe the current state of collaboration and highlight an example of a success story from Europe, which we believe demonstrates the extent of the “silo effect” between two fields, and whether more extensive collaboration could help solve problems associated with climate change and pests. 2 Methods A review was performed to quantify the collaborative relationships between researchers in the pest management and climate sciences. A search of the Web of Science (WoS) database was conducted using two broadly defined search terms: “climate change” and “pest” with the assumption that the latter term is used by authors in paper abstracts and/or as a keyword that includes all disciplines (e.g., weeds, insects, plant pathogens). While other databases exist (e.g., SCOPUS), WoS provided the greatest number of papers. The search was restricted to articles published in English beginning in 2000, when the term climate change became prominent in the literature (Fig. 1 ). These terms selected 104,655 climate change and 30,559 pest articles for a total of 134,179 (last date of search: 17/05/01). Articles from each search were downloaded and exported as tab separated text files. We extracted the first and last name of each author by searching for the regular expression /.*, [^ .]*/ within the name field using a data parser. We used the whole name field for entries that lacked the expression. Using this technique, we created subsets of articles authored by individuals with a specific last and first name. For authors inconstantly using or not using their middle initial or papers having two different authors who shared the same name, we compared the affiliations of the authors. For our metric of how similar two affiliations were, we used cosine similarity of bigrams. This allowed us to subdivide the papers of authors who share a name into groups where each paper in a group had a similar cosine similarity to another (>0.4). If an author had multiple affiliations on an article, then all were used to find whether she or he had authored additional articles. The bigram basis of the method accommodates cases with many short shared substrings that may have different formatting (e.g., department, university, cities, zip codes). In the future, author global identifiers (e.g., ORCID) would be more robust, although not all authors have such identifiers. Ultimately, we were able to define the domain of the authors to be either “climate change” or “pest” depending on affiliation and the data set in which we found the majority of their articles. Authors who had an equal number of articles in both categories, which we assumed were few, were not included in this part of the analysis, as they often published only a single paper in each category making the determination of where their expertise lies nearly impossible. 3 Results and discussion The lack of peer-reviewed publications with pest management and climate scientists as co-authors may be an indicator as to the slow rate of progress in addressing the challenges increasingly associated with pests and climate change. While collaboration is needed between scientists working on general climate and biology relationships, equally important is the coproduction of knowledge by climate and pest management scientists working on pest organisms responding to climate change. Our study brings to light the collaboration gap in the pest management and climate sciences. Of the 134,179 published papers on climate and pests, 0.8% (1035) were included in both climate change and pest datasets. The articles comprised 3.4% of the total number of pest-related articles and 1.0% of the total number of climate change-related articles, thus signaling the status of the exchange of knowledge and collaboration between the two fields. Since 2000, overlap in research that involves both fields increased at a relatively constant rate with a high of 187 articles at the intersection of pests or climate (Fig. 1). While the trends in articles are similar to the fields (pest, climate) and their intersection, a significant gap exists in the numbers. The coproduction of knowledge occurs when ongoing relationships between scientists are built, two-way communication is ensured, and useable science is the focus (Meadow et al., 2015). Omitting one or more of these factors can prevent the field(s) from moving forward and not fully addressing the urgent environmental challenge of pests and climate change. Not surprisingly, we found that individual researchers are unlikely to publish articles in both climate change and pest disciplines (Fig. 2 ). Only 8.2% of the authors who have published papers in our pest dataset have also published in our climate dataset and 2.8% of those who have published in the climate change dataset have published in the pest dataset. Even those who do publish in both fields tend to do so rarely; of those authors who have published in both datasets, 83% published only a single article in at least one of the datasets. Publishing numerous papers is even rarer: only 136 of the 306,912 (0.044%) authors in our dataset have published five or more articles in both domains, which we contend has limited our ability to better address the increasing problems of managing and monitoring pests in a changing climate. The author composition of individual articles also provides valuable insight (Table 1 ). For articles that are included in both datasets, 24% were written collaboratively between at least one researcher who specializes in each discipline (where specializes is determined from the relative number of papers published in each dataset, as discussed in the methods). Climate and pest management scientists wrote 39.1% and 25.1% of articles, respectively, where the topic spanned both disciplines. It is clear that articles which only appear in one of the domains are almost always written by authors from that domain (98% climate and 91% pests). Again, these results highlight the fact that collaborative research is largely lacking among pest management and climate scientists. Yet, questions remain as to whether greater coproduction of knowledge would equate to a better understanding of 1) pest response to climate change, 2) pest distribution and outbreak patterns, and 3) management and monitoring practices impacted. As an example of how these questions are being addressed, we used the Atopica project as a case study. In 2011, a team of individuals developed Atopica (Atopic diseases in changing climate, land use and air quality – www.Atopica.eu), which was a project funded by the European Commission (EC; grant agreement no.: 282687) to address environmental change and the effects on atopic diseases (allergies, asthma, eczema) in Europe. The main requirements for the Atopica team were to 1) investigate how factors such as climate variability, the spread of invasive plant species, and land use changes affect the spatial and temporal distribution of airborne allergens, in particular, pollen; and 2) determine the effect of these changes on the prevalence of atopic diseases in Europe, especially among vulnerable groups such as children under the age of ten, the elderly, and people with chronic disease. The Atopica team consisted of individuals with expertise in cellular and molecular biology, immunology, allergies, dermatology, physics, climate and air quality, and land use and they represented the countries of Austria, Italy, Croatia, France, Belgium, Germany and the United Kingdom. Individuals were from mainly academic, public institutions, which included universities, research institutes, hospitals, as well as small and medium-size enterprises, and an international organization. The objectives of the Atopica team were centered around airborne pollen concentration variability, effects on pollen allergenicity, sensitization and allergenic diseases in vulnerable groups, risk assessments, and health care and policy impacts. The Atopica team used a comprehensive approach that was based on a unique blend of theoretical, and computer modelling work, field campaigns, clinical studies, and laboratory experiments to address the interaction between environment and pollen and how these changes influence pollen allergenicity. All data including epidemiological and environmental simulations of climate, air quality, and pollen were collected and used to develop a range of appropriate dynamical, statistical and laboratory models to quantify the disease response to environmental stressors. During the project, a subset (“climate”) of the Atopica team identified climate conditions conducive to pollen emission, spread, and outbursts. In papers published by the climate team (see Laguel et al., 2015 and Storkey et al., 2014), they provide gridded simulations of recent past and projections of future airborne birch, Ambrosia artemisiifolia L. pollens, O3, NO2 and particulate matter concentrations and uncertainties. Another Atopica subset (“clinical”) team determined the prevalence and future incidence of allergy to A. artemisiifolia in children as well as the morbidity and severity coming from different levels of exposure during three consecutive pollination seasons. They also established the clinical relevance of A. artemisiifolia sensitization in elderly patients with new onset eczema in a region with new exposure to A. artemisiifolia. Together, the climate and clinical Atopica teams, quantified spatial and temporal dimensions of the association between pollen exposure and allergy (prevalence, severity) using regional case studies. (see Lake et al., 2016). A third Atopica subset (“allergy laboratory”) team studied the influence of air pollution and climate-modified allergenic pollens on allergic asthma and the associated mechanisms, which they plan to publish (Epstein, personal communication). Taken together, the transdisciplinary aspect of each subset contributed with added value to further understanding of the impending health problems due to the climate change effect on ragweed invasion. Atopica included diverse teams of researchers and a variety of stakeholders, such as non-governmental organizations, health authorities, and international groups, who represented the fields of health, climate, agriculture, environmental science, and journalism. In 2015, the Atopica team hosted a final conference for the project that included individuals from 25 countries (Fig. 3 ) representing 74 public and 29 private institutions (Fig. 4 ). In the fields of human health, agricultural research, climate science, and natural resources, individuals held positions in government (36), university (24), research institutes (20), consultant firms (17), patient organizations (13), and non-governmental organizations (7). Unlike the National Forum on Climate and Pests, numerous collaborations were developed through Atopica and several follow up grants have been written to continue research specifically focused on climate change and the impacts on an important pest species. 4 Conclusion A large amount of peer-reviewed research is published on climate change and pest management science, yet the low numbers of co-authors representing each discipline are evidence for lack of cross-disciplinary activity. Is this gap intentional or simply an unrecognized opportunity by individuals working in two different fields? The silo effect, which is the separation of individuals in a field of study or across several fields, is common in academia. Our results support this general phenomenon. However, a group like Atopica, which has brought together a diversity of individuals around a common topic, is an example of knowledge being coproduced to better understand and more quickly address a problem. By involving researchers in the health, climate, agriculture, and environmental science fields, the basic research that has emerged from the group (e.g., Storkey et al., 2014; Laguel et al., 2015) is the basis for applied studies (e.g., Lake et al., 2016) that will support better land management practices that are adapted to climate change to reduce a major pest plant. Atopica is an example of a deliberate and incentivized approach that did not have as its goal to improve collaboration among faculty, but instead to address a major societal challenge. In the end, the silos disappeared along with what is hoped will be A. artemisiifolia.

Textile Pollution Controlling Engineering Center of Ministry of Environmental Protection College of Environmental Science and Engineering Donghua University Shanghai 201620 China Editor: Zhen (Jason) He Abstract Environmental pollution and energy crisis have become recent worldwide concerns. Huge amounts of organic wastes are discharged into water bodies, causing serious environmental pollution. Meanwhile, these organic compounds are important carbon and energy sources that could be utilized instead of being discarded. A smart design of a photocatalytic fuel cell (PFC) can achieve double benefits: it can degrade organic pollutants and at the same time generate energy. In this review article, we discuss recent progress in the development of PFC systems, and summarize the principles for constructing advanced PFC systems. We particularly focus on the rational design of electrode materials in terms of surface, morphology, facet, and interfacial reaction engineering. The impact of important operational parameters on PFC performance is further discussed in detail. We then discuss the major limitations and opportunities for future PFCs research. The development of smart and advanced PFC systems depends on highly interdisciplinary collaborations, which require concerted efforts from the communities of materials science, chemistry, engineering, and environmental science.

These challenges may become even worse if no efficient and sustainable solutions were provided. Especially, the fast economic growth and rapid urbanization and industrialization in recent decades have resulted in huge amount of organic wastes (e.g., dyes, pharmaceuticals, aromatic hydrocarbons and other persistent organic compounds) that are discharged into water bodies (Sousa et al., 2018; Sheldon, 2018). This not only causes serious aquatic pollution, but also increases energy consumption for decontamination of polluted waters. In China, the total wastewater discharge amount reached 71.6\\u202fbillion\\u202ftons in 2015, which equivalents to a chemical oxygen demand (COD) amount of 22.9\\u202fmillion\\u202ftons (Xu et al., 2017). Conventional water and wastewater treatment technologies are ineffective towards removal and/or degradation of a number of contaminants that therefore emerge with increasing concentrations. In addition, some effective treatment processes such as reverse osmosis (RO) are typically energy–intensive (e.g., 5–100\\u202fkwh/kgCOD) (Azerrad et al., 2019; Prado et al., 2019). One feasible solution to this challenging issue is to add an additional advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) treatment unit to current water treatment facilities (Mansouri et al., 2019; Moreira et al., 2017; Li et al., 2019; Y. Liu et al., 2017, 2019). Various AOPs are capable of degradation of a wide range of organic compounds by generation of highly reactive radicals (e.g., hydroxyl radicals, •OH, holes, h+, and other reactive oxygen species, ROS) (Fu et al., 2018; Yan et al., 2016; Brady et al., 2018; Liu et al., 2018). Among them, semiconductor-based photocatalytic technologies are gaining growing acceptance as an effective and promising choice, thanks to their desirable features such as chemical inertness, high stability, low cost, high efficiency and low toxicity (Xu et al., 2018; Ma et al., 2014; Wang et al., 2019; K.M. Lee et al., 2016). Alternatively, the organic compounds in wastewater can serve as carbon and energy sources which can be further utilized. It is imperative to develop sustainable approaches that can simultaneously degrade these organic pollutants and recover their chemical energy. One successful design to fulfill these requirements is the use of microbial fuel cells (MFCs), which are considered a promising approach for wastewater treatment (Wang et al., 2015; S. Li et al., 2017; W.-W. Li et al., 2014). The greatest advantage of MFCs lies in the use of wastewater as a substrate (fuel), which breaks the traditional concept of wastewater treatment and allows for combining this with electricity generation. MFCs use bacteria as catalysts to oxidize organic substrates and release electrons at the anode, and subsequently consume these produced electrons at the cathode to produce electricity or hydrogen (Rabaey and Verstraete, 2005; Jiang et al., 2017; Sonawane et al., 2017). A wide variety of substrates can be applied to MFCs for electricity production, ranging from pure compounds (e.g., acetate, glucose, phenol, or ethanol) to complex mixtures of organic matters (e.g., biomass and other refractory wastewater) or even industrial wastewaters (Sheikhyousefi et al., 2017; Q. Zhao et al., 2017; Pandey et al., 2016; Doherty et al., 2015). However, there are still tremendous challenges and limitations yet to be addressed for large-scale efficient MFC technologies (Kumar et al., 2018; Osman et al., 2010), such as limited power generation, complex electron transport paths, slow electron transfer process, poor microbial selectivity to organic species, and a long bacterial start-up time (Osman et al., 2011; ElMekawy et al., 2013). Extensive studies suggest that generation and transport of electrons at the microbial anode is the limiting step for an MFC system (Choi, 2015; Jiang et al., 2014). If replacing the microbial anode of MFC with a high-performance photoanode (e.g., TiO2), the slow and complex biochemical electron transfer process in traditional MFCs may be substituted by a faster and more straightforward transport process of photogenerated electrons in photocatalysis (Cheng et al., 2012; Gan et al., 2012). Therefore, combining photocatalytic technology may provide a promising solution to address these existing limitations of conventional MFC systems (Ma et al., 2014; Li and Wu, 2015). The photocatalytic process is capable to degrade organic compounds at the photoanode, and constantly produces photogenerated electrons that can directly pass through the external circuit to the cathode for electricity (or hydrogen) production (Antoniadou et al., 2013, 2014; X.H. Liu et al., 2017). This combination results in a novel design called photocatalytic fuel cells (PFC), alternatively described as photo fuel cells or photo-assisted fuel cell systems. This design can achieve similar double benefits as MFC, namely simultaneous organic pollutant degradation and energy reclamation, but at a much higher efficiency, with a simpler and more practical approach. The rapid development of this field is reflected by an increase of publications over the years (Chen et al., 2012; Zeng et al., 2018a). It is noteworthy that several excellent review papers have described either photocatalytic degradation of organic pollutants or photocatalytic hydrogen generation (Devi and Kavitha, 2013; X.H. Zhang et al., 2016). However, to our best knowledge, only few review articles are available on this topic (Lianos, 2011, 2017). It is therefore timely to readdress this subject, to summarize recent advances with a focus on smart design of functional electrode materials. This will be of great interest to a broad readership in environmental science, materials science and chemistry. To this extent, here we review recent advances (2011–2019) on PFC systems. Next, we summarize the principles for construction of advanced PFC systems, with particular focus on the rational design of high-performance photoanode materials, followed by a brief discussion on the impact of operational parameters for PFC performance. At last, the present major limitations and future opportunities for PFC research are discussed. 2 Why photocatalytic fuel cells? A benchmark in the field of photocatalytic technology is the first discovery of photocatalytic water-splitting by single crystalline TiO2 electrode, as reported by Fujishima and Honda (1972). Follow Laser and Bard (1976) built a regenerative photoelectrochemical cell (PEC), which included a TiO2 photoelectrode and a Pt air electrode. Since then, a huge number of publications addressed the rational design of nanoscale photocatalysts towards pollutant remediation and/or H2 production. An PFC brings this concept one step further by decomposing organic pollutants, as well as simultaneously converting the chemical energy of organic substrates to electricity. The first report on PFC was presented by Kaneko et al. (2005) using a TiO2-coated FTO glass anode, a Pt cathode, and NH3 as “fuel”. Upon UV illumination, photodecomposition of NH3 was realized at the TiO2 photoanode, with H2 synchronous production at the cathode. Such design potentially offers an alternative solution to the global energy and environmental crisis and might start a huge revolution to conventional wastewater treatment technologies. Generally, a PFC system is composed of a photoanode that carries a semiconductor photocatalyst (e.g., TiO2), a cathode that carries the electrocatalyst (e.g., Pt), electrolytes, substrates, a reactor, and/or a membrane, as displayed in Fig. 1 . All these components play important roles in determining the performance of a PFC system. In particular, the microstructures of electrode materials are a crucial parameter for their functioning. Since the properties of functional materials are highly dependent on their structure, recent advances in nanotechnology may potentially boost the performance, in organic pollutants degradation, energy yield, or both. The fascinating physicochemical properties of nanomaterials also provide good possibilities. The design of functional nanomaterials depends on input from materials chemists. With proper insights of the chemistry involved, an optimal design can result in properties of functional nanomaterials that can be controlled and fine-tuned, such as their shape, morphology and facet. Also, the fast development of fuel cells, super-capacitors and lithium ion batteries provide valuable experiences that can be employed for the design and optimization of PFC systems. More details will be discussed in the next section, where the effect of electrode materials and other parameters on PFC performance are presented in detail. Compared with conventional MFCs, a PFC possesses, but may not be limited to, the following desirable features: 1) PFC can potentially utilize solar light as an energy source, enabling fast and direct production and transport of photogenerated electrons, and can degrade pollutants with high degradation efficiency; 2) PFC can use refractory or toxic organic compounds as substrate that cannot be effectively digested by microbes or would even inhibit their growth; 3) a PFC system can be easily constructed and operated under moderate reaction conditions and can easily be switched on and off by controlling the light input; 4) recent advances on nanotechnology enable a rational design of high-performance electrode materials for PFC; and 5) the strong oxidative capability of photogenerated holes and •OH ensures non-selective oxidation of substrates in a typical PFC. 3 Rational design of a PFC system When designing a PFC system, the transfer of electrons generated by a photoanode through an external circuit to the cathode is the essential process. Only then a complete circuit can be established. The photogenerated holes are consumed by substrates near the anode while produced electrons are consumed by protons (or oxygen) near the cathode. The corresponding cathodic reactions are given below: In the absence of oxygen, 2H + + 2e − → H 2 acidic condition 2H 2 O + 2e − → H 2 + 2OH − alkaline condition , In the presence of oxygen, 4H + + 2O 2 + 4e − → 2H 2 O acidic condition , 2H 2 O + 2O 2 + 4e − → 4OH − alkaline condition , Under aerobic acid condition, there are also radicals and related substances such as superoxide radical (·O2 −), hydrogen superoxide radical (HO2·) and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) produced by the reduction of O2 by two-electron at the cathode (Liu et al., 2015; Raptis et al., 2018; K. Zhao et al., 2017). As shown in Fig. 1, the energy input of a PFC system is only acquired from incoming photons, and no external bias is required. Thus, an internal potential difference between the anode and the cathode is necessary to drive the directional movement of the photogenerated electrons flowing from the photoanode to the cathode. Until now, two combinations of electrode materials were typically utilized in PFC systems, which will be briefly introduced in the following section. 3.1 Single photoelectrode PFC system A single photoelectrode PFC usually contains a semiconductor photoanode, a (dark) cathode, substrates and electrolytes. As displayed in Fig. 1, the anode and cathode are connected via an external load. In a PFC system, the photogenerated electrons are transferred from the anode to the cathode, so that the potential of the cathode is higher than that of the anode. The potential of a (dark) cathode is determined by the reduction reaction, while the potential of anode is determined by the Fermi level of the photocatalyst. For a typical n-type semiconductor (e.g., TiO2), the Fermi level is close to its conduction band, while for a p-type semiconductor, the Fermi level is close to its valence band. In the absence of oxygen, a photocatalytic reaction generating hydrogen occurs at the cathode, whose electric potential is generally equal to zero in standard condition (pH\\u202f=\\u202f0). Considering the pH of actual conditions and other inevitable losses, the difference in potential between anode and cathode is too weak to drive the PFC spontaneously, even if an n-type semiconductor photoanode is used. Recently, a monolithic photoelectrode formed by introducing a silica (Si) photovoltaic cell (PVC) coupled with a WO3/BiVO4 photoanode to overcome this limitation (Zeng et al., 2018b). The Si PVC served as additional power supplier driving the photogenerated electrons to the Pt-black/Pt cathode so that hydrogen and electricity are produced simultaneously. Alternatively, in the presence of oxygen, the cathode acts as an oxygen reduction electrode with an increased potential of 1.23\\u202fV (pH\\u202f=\\u202f0). In that case, even at alkaline conditions, a potential difference of several hundred millivolts can be obtained, which is sufficient to allow operation of the fuel cell. In the design of single photoelectrode fuel cells, n-type semiconductors are often preferred, such as a photoanode, for example: TiO2 (K. Zhao et al., 2017) and ZnO (Khalik et al., 2018), that operate under aerobic conditions, as this maximizes the potential differences between two electrodes. At the cathode, continuous oxygen purging is needed due to the limited solubility of oxygen in water (at maximum 8\\u202fmg/L at ambient conditions). This may require an additional pumping device which increases the operation costs (S.-L. Lee et al., 2016, 2018; Sun et al., 2019). This issue can also be partially addressed by employing a gas diffusion electrode (or air-breathing cathode), by depositing a Pt/C catalyst onto waterproof carbon cloth (B. Wang et al. 2014; Xie and Ouyang, 2017; Chamousis and Osterloh, 2012; Zhang et al., 2015), which improves the mass transport of oxygen at the cathode. For instance, Xie et al. (2018) constructed a visible-light responsive PFC composed of a Pt/C air breathing cathode and a BiVO4/WO3 photoanode. In their device, the Pt/C cathode is in direct contact with air and its specific surface area is much larger compared to Pt foil or Pt wire electrode. When glucose was used as substrate, the PFC displayed good performance with a maximum output power (JV)max of 8.58\\u202fμW/cm2 and a short-circuit current (JSC) of 91.8\\u202fμA/cm2. One major drawback for the abovementioned design is the dependence on a Pt cathode. This element is scarce and expensive, which significantly limits its potential for large-scale applications. For this reason, high-performance Pt-free cathodes have been developed. For example, it was reported that polypyrrole (ppy), NiO/buckypaper, and Co-N doped reduced graphene oxide could all serve as promising Pt-free electrocatalysts (Raptis et al., 2018). Balis et al. (2012) reported a one-step fabrication method to deposit ppy onto carbon cloth. Although inexpensive, the performance of this PFC was much lower compared to Pt/carbon black cathode. A further limitation came from the ageing of polymeric ppy, which may limit its long-term stability as electrode material. An alternative design was described by Sfaelou et al. (2012) who used a cathode based on modified buckypaper, composed of multiwall carbon nanotubes. After enrichment with NiO, the NiO/buckypaper cathode coupled with a ZnS-CdS@nc-TiO2 photoanode produced an open-circuit voltage (VOC) of 1.3\\u202fV, a JSC of 4.9\\u202fmA/cm2, and a (JV)max of 2.55\\u202fmW/cm2 when using ethanol as substrate, which was comparable with that of Pt/carbon-black/carbon-cloth cathodes (e.g., VOC of 1.2\\u202fV, JSC of 4.7\\u202fmA/cm2, (JV)max of 2.76\\u202fmW/cm2). The topographies of ppy and NiO/buckypaper materials are shown in Fig. 2a and Fig. 2b. Besides these, activated carbon and non-metal (e.g., N, S, and P) as well as transition metal (e.g., Fe, Co, and Ni) doped carbon frameworks may also good choices for the cathode materials. More in-depth studies interdisciplinary collaborations are required to develop other low-cost and high-performance electrode materials (Y. Zhang et al., 2018). A novel approach to accept electrons transferred from a photoanode to accomplish the reduction reaction is to employ a biocathode. A biocathode depends on enzymatic activity of microorganisms that catalyze the cathodic reaction while maintaining growth and metabolism (Zhang, Qu et al., 2018; Sui et al., 2017). Du et al. (2014) were the first to propose the concept of a biocathode-photocatalytic fuel cell (Bio-PFC) by choosing a nitrifying biocathode. Efficient cathodic nitrification of ammonia nitrogen was achieved (e.g., 34% of the NH4 + was converted into NO3 − within 4\\u202fh of Bio-PFC operation), while the performance was maintained as measured by anodic methyl orange degradation, which is superior to a control system using a Pt/C brush cathode. This suggests that a biocathode can serve as a promising alternative in terms of cell performance and operating costs. To date, several types of dark cathodes (Pt, Pt-free and microbial) have been developed with the aim to further boost pollutants removal performance and decrease operation costs. However, a dark cathode only serves as a passive electron acceptor in these cases, so the theoretical efficiency of a PFC depends entirely on the photoanode materials. Therefore, how to realize the transition from a passive cathode to an active cathode is the key to overcome this bottleneck, which calls for smarter design of advanced PFC systems. 3.2 Dual-photoelectrodes fuel cells To make full use of sunlight, a dual-photoelectrode design is proposed by replacing the dark cathode with a p-type semiconductor cathode. Fig. 3 presents the working principle of a typical dual-photoelectrode fuel cell, consisting of an n-type photoanode and a p-type photocathode. Both electrodes can be excited by photons with suitable energy. The key to this design is to rationally choose electrode materials. Generally, the Fermi level of a n-type semiconductor photoanode should be more negative than that of the p-type semiconductor photocathode. Under illumination, these dual-photoelectrodes produce photogenerated charge carriers. The dual-photoelectrode fuel cell acts similarly as a “Z-scheme” photocatalytic system, which endows stronger reduction/oxidation abilities of electrons/holes on each photoelectrodes (Kee et al., 2018). For this purpose, Chen et al. (2012) employed a Cu2O/Cu photocathode and a WO3/W photoanode to constitute a dual-photoelectrode PFC system. In their devise the Fermi-level difference between photoanode and photocathode drives the electron transfer. Photogenerated holes generated by the WO3/W photoanode directly decompose organic substrates, while water molecules are reduced by electrons at the Cu2O/Cu photocathode (Fig. 2c). This type of PFC device opens new opportunities for high-efficiency and low-cost photocathode materials. For example, based on the Fermi level differences between TiO2 and Cu2O, J. Li et al. (2013) established a TiO2/Ti photoanode combined with a Cu2O/Cu photocathode system that produced a VOC of 0.49\\u202fV, a JSC of 0.23\\u202fmA/cm−2 and a (JV)max of 0.36\\u202fmW/cm−2 when using 0.05\\u202fmol/L phenol as substrate. Furthermore, the different Fermi levels of two photoelectrodes can be directly reflected by the VOC of the PFC. This provides the theoretical guidance for rational selection of photoelectrodes. Wu et al. (2015) screened several semiconductor materials (e.g., TiO2, CdS, CdSe, and Cu2O) of different structures to verify this theory. Their results suggest that the VOC strongly depends on the Fermi level difference between the two photoelectrodes. The larger the Fermi level difference is between photoelectrodes, the greater VOC values can be obtained. The VOC also increased with the ratio of high index crystal facet of photoelectrodes. According to this theory, other effective designs with limited energy consumption are feasible for wastewater treatment (Bai et al., 2016; Pan et al., 2018; Urushidate et al., 2018). For example, a design that takes full advantage of nanoscale materials can overcome some inherent shortcomings like photo-corrosion in narrow band-gap semiconductors (e.g., Cu2O). Novel photocathodes with visible light response, enhanced photostability and a large surface area can now be produced. Improved pollutant degradation performance and energy production rates have been reported, for instance, Cu2O/CuO thin film electrodes (X. Li et al., 2018) and 3D ZnO/Cu2O nanowire (Fig. 2d) (Bai et al., 2015). Chen et al. (2013, 2014) chose a Si photovoltaic cell (PVC) as the photocathode, which was photostable, responsive to visible light, and more importantly had a mismatched Fermi level when combined with a WO3 photoanode. After decoration with Pt catalyst, the oxygen reduction reaction proceeded smoothly at the Pt/PVC cathode. Upon illumination, complete mineralization of methylene blue was achieved within 90\\u202fmin together with a stable JSC of 350\\u202fμA/cm2. Beyond that, the same system could also be used for spontaneous water dissociation under visible light. 4 Recent advances on photoanode materials of PFC The photoanode is the most important component in a PFC system, as it determines how many substrate molecules can be degraded and how much energy can be produced per unit of time. Thus, it is highly desirable to develop advanced photoanode materials with improved charge separation performance and a suppressed recombination rate between electron-hole pairs. Among the photoanode materials reviewed, a specific focus is dedicated to TiO2, as this is the most promising and most extensively researched photoanode materials. It is well documented that the performance of nanoscale photoanodes is strongly influenced by their surface, morphology, facet and interfacial reactions (M. Li et al., 2017). By fine-tuning these parameters, some of photoanode materials with diversified composition, structure and morphology were prepared as displayed in Fig. 4 , in which (a) TiO2 nanotubes arrays; (b) WO3 nanoflakes; (c) BiVO4/WO3 composite; (d) TiO2 /WO3 /W nanorods. 4.1 Surface engineering of photoanode materials Extensive studies suggest that the photochemical performance of an n-type semiconductor (e.g., TiO2) can be improved by deposition of noble metals (e.g., Pt, Ag, or Au) on their surface. The noble metal forms a Schottky barrier at the interface of the semiconductor. Once the work function of noble metal is higher than that of semiconductor, electrons can spontaneously flow from the n-type semiconductor to the noble metal. Furthermore, thanks to the surface plasma resonance effect of noble metal nanoparticles, the light response range of photoanode can be extended to a visible light range. Several successful designs have been reported, e.g., an Ag−TiO2 (Sui et al., 2017; Deng et al., 2018), or Ag/AgCl/GO photoanode (Liu et al., 2016). Yan et al. (2018) developed a novel H2O2-based PFC system composed of a nano-Au/g-C3N4 photoanode and a hemin-graphene composite cathode and applied these to a substrate of H2O2. Both anodic photocatalytic oxidation and cathodic reduction of H2O2 contributed to the generation of electrical power. In addition, such a system can serve as a self-powered aptasensor due to the inhibited PFC performance in presence of 3,3′,4,4′-tetrachlorobiphenyl. Surface complexation with other narrow band-gap semiconductors to form heterojunctions has also been applied to extend the photochemical performance of an n-type semiconductor. Under light exposure, photogenerated electrons and holes are transferred in opposite directions due to the presence of the internal electrical field between the two semiconductors. As a result, electrons accumulate at the semiconductor with the lower conduction band while holes accumulate at materials that have a higher valence band. Several combinations of n-type TiO2 with other narrow band-gap semiconductors have been tested, e.g., combined with CdS (Huang et al., 2018; Liu et al., 2011a), ZnFe2O4 (Xie et al., 2017), or BiVO4 (Bai et al., 2016; J. Li et al., 2018). These heterojunctions not merely facilitate the separation of electron-hole pairs and suppress their recombination, but also significantly improve the utilization of sunlight and dramatically enhance the efficiency of PFCs. For this purpose, Xia et al. (2016) developed a BiVO4-WO3 heterojunction electrode via a layer-by-layer deposition of BiVO4 on the surface of a porous WO3/W support. Such design may solve the existing limitations of a WO3 anode that typically has a slow photo-response rate, suffer from loss of photoactivity due to the accumulation of per‑oxygen species, and produce a relatively high recombination rate of photon-generated carriers as a result of surface defects. Within the composite anode, WO3 and BiVO4 form a staggered band-gap structure, so that electrons are transferred to the conduction band of WO3, while holes migrate to the valence band of BiVO4. Therefore, the probability of electron–hole recombination is significantly suppressed. Under these circumstances, a WO3/W film deposited with four layers of BiVO4 produced the highest photocurrent density of 2.01\\u202fmA/cm2 at 0.6\\u202fV (vs Ag/AgCl) and was demonstrated to result in a 180% and 205% increase of photoactivity, compared to pure WO3 and pure BiVO4, respectively. Great progresses have been achieved in the development of heterostructure photoanode materials with extended light absorption properties, however, there are still room to further boost the performance by rational design nanomaterials as well as fine-tune their compositions. Further, detail understanding of the separation and transport of photogenerated carriers at the solid-liquid interfaces are of significance as well. 4.2 Morphology engineering of photoanode materials The physicochemical properties of functional nanoscale materials are highly dependent on their micro- or nanostructures. To further improve the photochemical performance of photoanode materials, various nanoscale materials were developed with different structures and nanoscale morphologies (e.g., nanowires, nanopores, nanotubes, nanoflowers, nanorods, nanobelts, and nanorings) and of different dimensions (from 1D to 3D). Compared with nanoparticles, the electron transport performance in 1D or quasi-1D nanostructures is much faster, mainly due to their increased specific surface area and decreased internal resistance. Moreover, the nanotube structure could capture more photons compared with nanoparticles. Liu et al. (2011b) established a PFC system composed of a short TiO2 nanotube array (~280\\u202fnm in length) anode combined with a Pt cathode. Since the nanotubes were directly grown on a conductive Ti substrate, the naturally formed Schottky junction provided a unique channel for the rapid transfer of photogenerated electrons and an increased mechanical stability. As summarized in Table 1 , this PFC system revealed enhanced photoelectrical conversion performance compared with those employing a longer TiO2 nanotube photoanode or a TiO2 nanoparticle photoanode. Since then, Ying et al. (2016) have developed a pit-type TiO2 nanotube arrays photoanode with cavities enlarged to microscales (0.78\\u202fμm) by introducing pulsed ultrasonication during fabrication. They reported that this increased the surface roughness, which was beneficial for the adsorption of organic molecules onto the photoanode, while the microscale holes facilitated full contact of organic substrates with pit walls. In conclusion, surface engineering of photoanode materials provides a favorable means to further boost PFC performance, and opens new possibilities for in-depth research to unveil the underlying working mechanisms. 4.3 Facet engineering of photoanode materials Besides the aforementioned strategies, crystal facet engineering of semiconductors has become a promising approach for fine tuning physicochemical properties and boosting the reactivity and selectivity of novel materials (Liu et al., 2011c; Bai et al., 2017). Several articles are available on this aspect so that we only briefly introduce the main working principles of facet engineering and describe two examples for PFC applications here. The facets exposed on a photocatalyst surface may affect the photocatalytic performance via different mechanisms. As shown in Fig. 5 , the surface atomic arrangements and crystal orientation of photocatalysts is not only closely related to their catalytic activity, but also determines the redox ability of photogenerated charge carriers. A typical example is BiOCl, a wide band-gap semiconductor. If untreated, BiOCl cannot be activated directly by visible light. Nevertheless, after sensitization by dyes (e.g., rhodamine B or methylene green), it can be excited by visible light (K. Li et al., 2013). The reason can be ascribed to the {010} facet of BiOCl that possesses a large surface area and open channel structure, which is beneficial for loading of dye molecules and exposure of more catalytic active sites, while the {010} facet of BiOCl possess high surface energy, which decreases rapidly during crystal growth (Jiang et al., 2012). L. Zhang et al. (2017, 2018) have developed a 3D nanoflower BiOCl with more exposed {010} facet and employed it as the anode of a dye self-photosensitized PFC. In order to further improve the chemical reactivity and the transfer rate of photoelectrons, an ultrathin BiOCl nanosheet (3.48\\u202fnm thickness) with predominant {010} facet was synthesized. As expected, the system exhibited excellent visible light response properties and enhanced power generation performance (Table 1). In addition, heterogeneous nucleation and growth of specific crystal facets can also take place by fine-tuning the materials' interface. Based on the matched bands and lattice structure of WO3 and TiO2, a TiO2/WO3/W composite photoanode was designed by controlling the {001}–oriented TiO2 grown on the surface of single crystals of WO3 (Zeng et al., 2018a). The epitaxial growth of the TiO2 layer uniformly covered the WO3 nanorods surface to prevent corrosion from formation of surface peroxo-species during the photocatalytic process. The {001} direction of anatase TiO2 exhibited a spiny morphology, which endowed the TiO2/WO3/W photoanode an increased specific surface area with more exposed active sites. TiO2 and WO3 nanorods form a type-II heterojunction, and the separation and migration of their photogenerated carriers was improved due to the presence of an internal electrical field between TiO2 and WO3. In this composite photoanode material, the WO3 layer was directly connected to the W substrate. Such compact combinations are favorable for fast transport of photogenerated electrons due to reduced resistance. In addition, such microstructures demonstrate improved mechanical stability. 4.4 Interfacial reaction engineering A typical photochemical process usually employs two electrode plates and is operated in a flow-by mode. This configuration results in a relatively large hydrodynamic diffusive boundary layer (>100\\u202fμm) and is not favorable for the rapid reaction of organics with •OH due to limited diffusion. Especially the oxidation reaction principally occurs at the solid-liquid interface of photoanode materials (Fang et al., 2014). Theoretical modeling and experimental studies suggest that this oxidation reaction only occurs within 1\\u202fμm of the anode surface (Donaghue and Chaplin, 2013). Given that this is a limitation of the electrode itself, the reaction interface cannot be expanded indefinitely. This limits the capacity of pollutant degradation and power generation performance of a PFC device. To address this issue, Q. Zhao et al. (2017) introduced an advanced PFC system by applying Fe2+ ions that trigger a sustained radical chain reaction based on the conversion of Fe2+ and Fe3+. This design extends the radical-mediated reactions from the electrode surface to the entire solution. Since both Fe3+ and Fe2+ are sensitive to the solution pH, the Fe3+/Fe2+ Fenton-PFC system only works in an acidic environment (around 3.0). Such narrow range of pH significantly limits its application in the actual wastewater treatment. To address this issue, researchers have rationally selected chelating agents to coordinate with metal ions to keep it soluble at elevated pH conditions. For example, ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) and tetrapolyphosphate (TPP) were combined with Fe3+/Fe2+ to form stable water-soluble complexes at neutral condition for PFC applications (Xia et al., 2018; Li et al., 2019). Not surprisingly, the as-formed complexes (Fe3+/Fe2+-EDTA and Fe3+/Fe2+-TPP) successfully initiated chain reactions under alkaline environment and boosted the cell performance evidently. A similar concept was also realized by introducing persulfate (S2O8 2−) and chlorine radicals (Cl•) into a PFC system (Y. Zhang et al., 2018). N. Li et al. (2018) applied S2O8 2− as electron sacrificial agent to produce SO4•− and SO4 2− at the cathode, or even as “fuel” (to be activated by UV light) to produce SO4•− as well. The thus produced SO4•− possesses comparable or even higher oxidative potential (2.5–3.1\\u202fV compared to 2.7\\u202fV for •OH) and it can adapt to a wider pH range. This also extends the radical reactions to the whole solution with resulting enhanced photocatalytic efficiency. The interfacial reaction engineering provides a promising route to expand potential applications of PFC technology to wastewater treatment and power generation. 5 Impact of other operational parameters on PFC performance As mentioned above, the production of electrical energy through photocatalytic degradation of organic pollutants in a PFC system is an attractive topic with double environmental benefits. In the last section, the impact of substrate, electrolytes and reactor design on the PFC performance are briefly introduced. 5.1 Substrate matters For degradation of organic substrates, the photogenerated holes with strong oxidation ability are essential, as these either react with the substrates directly or are converted to •OH before degrading organic substrates. During the reaction, the substrate molecules near the anode are continuously consumed, forming a concentration gradient between the anode surface and the bulk solution. This favors the substrate molecules to diffuse towards the photoanode surface and as such improves the PFC performance (He et al., 2018). However, an optimal substrate concentration exists, beyond which PFC performance is reduced, as at high concentrations the reaction rate is no longer limited by mass transport. In addition, the mass transport of substrate molecules can also be affected by the flow of liquid (convection) (Parmar et al., 2015). These principles are also applicable to the cathode, where a reduction reaction occurs (Lee et al., 2018a, 2018b; Sui et al., 2015). The oxidation of substrates obviously varies with the types of substrate and depends on presence of certain group such as alcohols, saccharides, carboxylic acids, amines, aromatics and azo dyes (S.-L. Lee et al., 2016; Li et al., 2015). For example, alcoholic compounds presented a “current-doubling effect” during decomposition (Hu et al., 2015). This effect is formed by injecting an additional electron, resulting from photoanodic decomposition of alcoholic groups, to the conduction band of photocatalysts with a resulting increase in current. The result is a typical enhancement in efficiency of PFC systems compared to substrates lacking alcoholic groups. Generally speaking, substrates with the shorter carbon chain lengths and simpler molecular structures result in faster degradation kinetics and improved cell performance (e.g., alcohols and monosaccharides as opposed to long-chain fatty acids or polysaccharides) (Lee et al., 2018b; Seger et al., 2012). 5.2 Electrolyte matters A certain amount of electrolyte is usually added to the reaction medium to enhance ion transport and reduce the internal resistance of the cell. It has been reported that a moderate increase in electrolyte concentration can improve the conductivity in the reaction chamber, boost the charge transfer, and thereby enhance the output energy of PFC systems (B. Wang et al. 2014; Liao et al., 2015). Meanwhile, various electrolytes may cause different reactions and enable different charge transfer mechanisms (K.M. Lee et al., 2016; Khalik et al., 2016). The commonly used electrolytes in the PFC systems are inorganic salts such as sulfates, nitrates, phosphates, or persulfate salts and alkali (e.g., KOH, NaOH). Among these, sulfates (Na2SO4) is frequently used, due to its inert and stable chemical properties. Persulfate is special compared to other supporting electrolytes, as it can be used as an inorganic sacrificial agent for electrons to produce highly reactive SO4•− (Zhang et al., 2017). Phosphate (KH2PO4) solution functions both as a supporting electrolyte and a buffer solution, keeping the solution at neutral pH conditions (Yan et al., 2017). The choose of electrolyte for a PFC system is closely related to the electrode materials used as well as the solution pH conditions. Certain semiconductor oxide electrodes demonstrate enhanced photochemical performance in alkaline electrolytes. Because the photogenerated holes can be directly consumed by the abundant OH– to generate ·OH (Li et al., 2015; Raptis et al., 2018). While WO3 photocatalysts are stable both in acidic and neutral electrolyte solution (Xie and Ouyang, 2017). However, some chalcogenide-based photoanodes could be rapidly corroded by acidic electrolyte, consequently, it can only be used under neutral and alkaline conditions. Moreover, considering the instability of chalcogenide-based photoanodes, sulfide-sulfite electrolytes combination has been used to serve as inorganic sacrificial agents, further hindering the chalcogenide compound dissolution (B. Wang et al., 2014). 5.3 Reactor configurations matters The reactor configuration of a PFC system directly determines the fluid flow state as well as transmission of photons. In a typical setup (see Fig. 6a), a H-shaped reactor design is connected with an ion-exchange membrane (Lianos, 2011). An internal chemical potential can be produced by adding different electrolyte into different compartments. The mass transport can be partially alleviated by purging gas or magnetic stirring. One evident drawback in this design is that the distance between the anode and cathode is relatively large, which significantly increases the internal resistance of the system and deteriorates the overall cell performance. Alternatively, a one-compartment reactor devoid of a membrane was designed to shorten the distance between electrodes (Ye et al., 2018; Nahyoon et al., 2018). To further improve the mass transport, a rotating disk film electrode has been designed (see Fig. 6b) (Tang et al., 2014; Li et al., 2016). When the round disk photoanode was coated with a microscale aqueous film, its upper part was illuminated with light directly, while the lower part was immersed in the solution. In this way, light absorption by the solution was greatly minimized and the transport of mass was enhanced. Further, inspired by optofluidic technologies (features with enhanced mass and photon transfer, as well as uniform light distribution) (N. Wang et al., 2014; H. Zhang et al., 2016), L. Li et al. (2014) constructed an optofluidic PFC by stacking PDMS (polydimethylsiloxane) onto an FTO photoanode and a carbon paper cathode onto an SU-8 negative photo-resist. As shown in Fig. 6c, the photoanode and cathode were installed face to face. The dimension of the reactor was 2\\u202fcm\\u202f×\\u202f1\\u202fcm\\u202f×\\u202f250\\u202fμm with an effective volume of only 40\\u202fμL. The short distance between the two electrodes allows for membrane-free operation. Due to the inherent large surface-to-volume ratio, enhanced performance with a power density of 0.58\\u202fmW/cm2 and a pollutant degradation efficiency of 83.9% was obtained. Moreover, Li et al. (2015) designed a sandwich structure of optofluidic PFC composed of a photoanode and a cathode distributed on both sides of the reaction chamber. The two electrodes were placed back to back in the center of the chamber with a distance of 7\\u202fmm between photoanode and cathode. With different electrolytes, the best discharging performance was obtained using alkaline electrolyte (resulting in a (JV)max of 4.08\\u202fW/cm2 when employing methanol as substrate), due to improved dynamic and charge transfer performance. 6 Summary and perspectives To date, the exploitation of PFC devices has mainly focused on the development of high-performance photoanode materials, dual photo-electrodes PFCs, and multifunctional PFCs (e.g., sensors). While significant progress has been made in these areas, significant future efforts are still required. A number of scientific issues remain to be addressed to develop high-performance PFC systems, such as: 1) What is the relationship between the physicochemical properties of electrode materials and their corresponding cell performance? 2) How can state-of-the-art nanotechnology be incorporated into PFC systems to further boost the cell performance? 3) Can a PFC system be scaled up for practical applications? and 4) How to effectively utilize the produced electricity or hydrogen? In fact, these issues are of critical importance for future developments of any PFC system. To address these fundamental issues, continuous and concerted efforts are required that depend both on theoretical calculations and experimental data, whose combined approaches may eventually provide the required insights towards the underlying relationships between electrode structure and cell performance. This may significantly advance the fundamental knowledge of electrode materials and lead to a novel approach of energy production, and consequently, provide the know-how for developing practical and useful devices.

The Netherlands National Institute for Public Health and the Environment (RIVM) Center for infectious Disease Control Antonie van Leeuwenhoeklaan 9 Bilthoven 3721 MA Netherlands Abstract Collaborative approaches in health, such as One Health (OH), are promising; nevertheless, several authors point at persistent challenges for designing and implementing OH initiatives. Among other challenges, OH practitioners struggle in their efforts to collaborate across disciplines and domains. This paper aims to provide insights into the existing challenges for designing and implementing OH initiatives, their causes and solutions, and points out strategic solutions with the potential to solve practical challenges. A systematic literature search was performed for emerging challenges and proposed solutions in the process of conducting OH initiatives. Next, a thematic and a causal analysis were performed to unravel challenges and their causes. Finally, solutions were discriminated on whether they were only recommended, or implemented as a proof-of-principle. The 56 included papers describe 21 challenges endured by OH initiatives that relate to different themes (policy and funding; education and training; surveillance; multi-actor, multi-domain, and multi-level collaborations; and evidence). These challenges occur in three different phases: the acquisition of sufficient conditions to start an initiative, its execution, and its monitoring and evaluation. The findings indicate that individual challenges share overlapping causes and crosscutting causal relations. Accordingly, solutions for the successful performance of OH initiatives should be implemented to tackle simultaneously different types of challenges occurring in different phases. Still, promoting collaboration between the wide diversity of stakeholders, as a fundamental aspect in the OH approach, is still by far the most challenging factor in performing OH initiatives. Causes for that are the difficulties in promoting meaningful and equal participation from diverse actors. Solutions proposed for this challenge focused on guiding stakeholders to think and collaborate beyond their professional and cultural silos to generate knowledge co-creation and innovative methodologies and frameworks. Finally, the biggest knowledge gap identified, in terms of proposed solutions, was for monitoring and evaluating OH initiatives. This highlights the need for future research on evaluation methods and tools specific for the OH approach, to provide credible evidence on its added value. When considering challenges endured by former OH initiatives and the proposed solutions for these challenges, practitioners should be able to plan and structure such initiatives in a more successful way, through the strategic pre-consideration of solutions or simply by avoiding known barriers. Keywords One health Challenges Design Implementation Interdisciplinary collaboration Transdisciplinary research, strategic solutions Abbreviations EIDs Emerging infectious diseases ID Interdisciplinary OH One Health TD Transdisciplinary 1 Introduction During the 21st century, diverse global health problems have emerged, mostly related to climate change, environmental sustainability, zoonotic and (re)emerging infectious diseases (EIDs). Innovative actions are needed to effectively address such problems. Defined as “a worldwide strategy for expanding interdisciplinary collaborations and communications in all aspects of health for people, animals and the environment” [1], One Health (OH) initiatives are promising. In fact, the OH approach is not a new concept; for many years, the link between animal and human health has been recognized. Nevertheless, it has suffered constant modifications in its definition and scope. From One Medicine, aimed at addressing animal-human interactions; passing through Ecohealth, advocating for the inclusion of the environmental components of health; to One World – One Health, the OH approach has finally recognized the importance of linking human, animal and environmental health [2–6]. Still, several authors have mentioned persistent challenges for designing and implementing OH initiatives, many of which are related to the necessity to include a wide range of relevant professionals, since each contribute valuable skills and perspectives that will ultimately advance the cause [7]. Despite the consensual OH definition that emerged in recent years, the level of collaboration required in the OH approach is not yet agreed upon. Most of the OH initiatives are based on interdisciplinary (ID) collaborations, implying the integration of different disciplines and cooperation between diverse experts, creating possibilities for knowledge co-creation. More recent initiatives, however, advocate for taking a whole society approach, which implies a transdisciplinary (TD) level of collaboration, with the inclusion of stakeholders beyond the academic domain [8,9]. Some authors advocate that taking a TD approach can better address complex global health challenges, due to the consideration of local contexts and the inclusion of community stakeholders, which contribute to the adoption and sustainability of OH initiatives [8,9]. The inclusion of diverse stakeholders under the OH approach, however, can lead to conflicts due to their manifold interests and priorities. Examples of collaborative conflicts are power imbalances, conflicts of interest and coordination gaps that can occur at an ID level but especially at a cross-sectoral, participatory TD level [10]. Besides these collaboration barriers, the different interpretations of the OH scope translate into diversity in the implementation of OH initiatives, generating challenges for the development of standards and guidelines for OH practitioners. This empirical gap and the manifold challenges endured by OH initiatives have been identified in the literature [2,4,11], highlighting the need for guidance on how to address collaboration and implementation challenges for the OH approach. Reviewing and understanding such challenges is therefore essential to address the complexity in performing OH initiatives. Zoonotic and emerging infectious diseases require fast actions that are only possible through the design of OH initiatives in line with the acknowledgement of potential challenges and possible solutions [12]. Through a systematic literature review, this paper identifies challenges for designing and implementing OH initiatives, their causes and proposed solutions. The objective is to support the development and performance of the OH approach by providing insights on existing challenges, besides identifying proposed and implemented solutions that have the potential to solve multiple challenges. 2 Materials and methods A systematic review of the literature was carried out to identify potential challenges and possible solutions for designing and implementing OH initiatives. 2.1 Search strategy In order to provide an overview of challenges to designing and implementing OH initiatives and enable further discussion on how those initiatives attempt to address such challenges, we sampled the population of published peer-reviewed papers that mentioned OH initiatives and the challenges endured by them. For the systematic search, the online databases of PubMed and Web of Science were used, due to their broad scope of publication and multi-disciplinary contents. The key terms applied on the search were “one health” and “challenges”. The final searching syntax was as the following: (challenges OR difficulties OR barriers OR problems) AND (“one health” OR “eco health” OR “one medicine”). The final search was performed on August 31, 2017. 2.2 Eligibility criteria and selection of studies After the systematic search, different inclusion and exclusion criteria were used to select the papers for this review. Papers were included when they considered OH initiatives according to the definition and scope applied by the OH initiative movement [1]. This scope consists of two aspects: 1) aiming to enhance collaboration and communication in all aspects of health and 2) recognizing the link between animal, human and/or environmental domains. Papers were excluded when they described OH as an outcome (e.g. did not discuss challenges endured by OH initiatives, but the challenges that lead to their creation), or when they did not present any challenges. The search was not restricted by year of publication, study design or any further factors, but language (English). Fig. 1 depicts the selection process for the inclusion and exclusion of papers. After removing duplicates that were identified by both databases, the papers were screened in two phases: first the title and abstract, and second the full text of the papers were screened. Papers were excluded if they did not meet the inclusion criteria by not referring to OH initiatives, or by employing a OH definition that was not in accordance with the definition and scope previously described (e.g. discussed challenges from a single disciplinary perspective not engaging in cross-disciplinary collaborations). Additionally, papers that did not discuss empirical challenges endured by OH initiatives or discussed challenges that lead to their creation (OH as an outcome) were excluded. After conducting the systematic search, the authors identified extra articles of relevance to the topic of this review; those were added manually to the dataset. A total of 56 papers were included in this review, which were diverse in type of study, geographic location, approach, and field of publication (see Table A.1 in the Appendix). The included articles were compiled for analysis with the aid of the referencing software Endnote. 2.3 Data extraction and analysis After the selection of studies, papers were screened systematically to identify challenges and proposed solutions within the breadth of the literature. Secondly, a thematic analysis was performed to classify the identified challenges and solutions following both chronological phases of realization and emerging themes. Solutions were classified on their extent of implementation indicating whether they were only recommended or also implemented in specific cases. Thirdly, a causal analysis was conducted, through the construction of a causal tree, to unravel arguments for defining causal relations between challenges [13–15]. Finally, a semi-quantitative analysis was performed to measure the frequency in which challenges and solutions were mentioned by the included papers. The authors highlight here that although the search strategy was focused on identifying challenges in the performance of One Health initiatives, most of the included papers either proposed or discussed solutions to address such challenges, which are later elaborated in this review by discriminating practical examples of implementation. 3 Results 3.1 Defining OH challenges From the analysis of the 56 included papers, 21 single challenges for designing and implementing OH initiatives were identified. Based on the thematic analysis, the challenges were classified in different themes that emerged during the data analysis. Firstly, challenges were grouped in three distinct chronological process phases: (a) conditions for starting, (b) execution, and (c) monitoring and evaluation. Although chronological process phases were used to group challenges, a pertinent point is that in practice such phases are not necessarily consecutive and unrelated, but rather interactive and iterative [16]. In other words, phases can and usually do occur in parallel mode, overlapping from time to time. Secondly, challenges were classified in the emerging themes of policy and funding, education and training, surveillance, multi-actor (ID) collaborations, multi-domain (TD) collaborations, multi-level collaborations (across different institutional levels), and evidence. 3.1.1 Conditions for starting Challenges under this group relate to difficulties for OH practitioners to acquire and establish the necessary conditions for starting their initiatives. Conditions for starting and executing projects have to be created at different levels: at an external and institutional context level (systemic); and at an internal local context within projects [16]. Still, the acquisition of conditions has to be performed not only in the beginning of a project but throughout the whole process (including execution and monitoring and evaluation). In relation to the thematic classification, challenges for acquiring conditions for starting OH initiatives comprise the themes of insufficient policy prioritization and funding, and the lack of OH educational and training programs, as described in Table 1 . Policy support, access to funds, and trained professionals, able to understand and implement the OH approach, are basic conditions to facilitate the start and smooth execution of OH initiatives. Therefore, addressing condition challenges is considered an important first step towards the successful design and implementation of OH initiatives [2]. Some authors also elaborate on the interdependency of these themes [26,29,44–46,53]. While on the one hand, without policy support and funding, educational and training programs cannot be enhanced; on the other hand, educated and trained personnel are necessary for improving and increasing OH advocacy and message development for policy-makers and the public, and therefore enhancing policy support and funding. 3.1.2 Execution For those initiatives that are able to meet the necessary conditions for starting, many practitioners also encounter challenges on the next step of their execution (see Table 2 ). Next to the difficulties in performing OH surveillance, execution challenges relate to problems in collaboration between multiple actors, in multiple domains and at multiple levels. Most of these challenges are perceived at the local (project) level, while performing the experimental initiatives. Nevertheless, the roots of such challenges usually come from structures institutionalized at a systemic level. The challenges affecting the execution of OH initiatives are highly influenced by problems in acquiring conditions, which already started in the initial phase and persist until the monitoring and evaluation. This is especially the case for the difficulties in performing OH surveillance, which are mainly caused by the poor availability of resources and personnel [2,9,19,30,31,36]. The challenges in stakeholder collaboration relate to the fact that a multidisciplinary team of scientists, working together but within their own silo, is not enough for the knowledge co-creation proposed in OH innovations. Nevertheless, such superficial collaborations are a long-term heritage of fragmented systems and practices that influence the flexibility of actors and their organizations to collaborate and integrate diverse ideas, methods and actions [2,22,48,52]. 3.1.3 Monitoring & evaluation To facilitate the adoption, upscaling and institutionalization of OH initiatives, clear evidence of the added value of performing such initiatives needs to be provided. However, a range of challenges relate specifically to the difficulties in performing monitoring and evaluation of OH initiatives (see Table 3 ). Poor monitoring and evaluation of OH initiatives hamper performance assessment of prior (implemented) initiatives and therefore the gathering of evidence on their effectivity and efficiency. Challenges in monitoring and evaluating OH initiatives were mentioned as major, and it was argued that they hinder more widespread political interest and support for the OH approach [24,52]. 3.2 Causal relation of challenges After the identification of individual challenges, a causal analysis was performed to unravel the causal relations between the different challenges, through the construction of a causal tree. For an overview of the complete causal tree of challenges, refer to Fig. A.1 in the Appendix. The tree follows a line of argumentation in which causal factors for challenges are hierarchically clustered. As a result causes that are (perceived as) more tangible are at the top and causes that are more fundamental and embedded in the system are at the bottom [66]. In Fig. 2 , a simplified version of the causal tree is presented depicting the interconnection between the main (groups of) challenges and positioning them according to the previously described causal line of argumentation. The root-causes for all types of challenges are placed at two different types of fragmentations. The institutional-academic fragmentation relates to differences in educational and professional pathways, and organizational structure, resulting in diverse methodological preferences, practices, background assumptions and normative orientations of actors [67–69]. The geographic-cultural fragmentation is embedded in historical, geographic and social factors, resulting in conflicting actions, values and even disparities in knowledge and capacity. Added to the qualitative analysis, a semi-quantitative assessment of the frequency in which the different challenges were mentioned by the included papers was performed. Most of the included papers mentioned challenges located at the phase of execution, followed by challenges in the conditions for starting and finally challenges for the monitoring and evaluation phases. Regarding the thematic classification, most papers mentioned challenges related to multi-actor collaborations (n\\u202f=\\u202f36); followed by policy and funding (n\\u202f=\\u202f31), and multi-domain collaborations (n\\u202f=\\u202f27), respectively. Equally mentioned were the themes of surveillance, and education and training (n\\u202f=\\u202f22). The least mentioned themes were evidence (n\\u202f=\\u202f19) and multi-level collaborations (n\\u202f=\\u202f13). 3.3 Defining solutions for OH challenges Next, the 56 included papers were analysed for solutions addressing the challenges in designing and implementing OH initiatives. Following the same thematic analysis used to classify challenges, solutions were organized according to phases and themes. In addition, solutions were discriminated on their status of implementation by indicating whether they were only recommended by the authors or also implemented in practice. The implemented solutions serve as examples of strategies that attempted to solve challenges for performing OH initiatives in practice. Notably, the papers not always described solutions for the exact same challenges mentioned in their content. Some articles proposed solutions for only few of the mentioned challenges, while others presented solutions beyond mentioned challenges. For this reason, solutions are not linked to individual challenges but rather broadly related to the thematic groups. 3.3.1 Solutions for improving conditions for starting The solutions proposed for boosting the start of OH initiatives aim at acquiring and establishing the necessary conditions such as improving political support and access to funds, and enhancing the educational and training opportunities for OH practitioners (see Table 4 ). The solutions proposed to improve policy support and funding for OH initiatives elaborate especially on enhancing OH advocacy through better message development and collaborations with policy-makers. The solutions proposed to improve OH education and training emphasize the need of implementing ID and TD training programs and educational departments, as well as taking a more holistic approach to educational programs with the inclusion of different disciplines and courses on interpersonal skills. For only two solutions no implemented examples were mentioned: 1) strategies to increase policy-makers awareness about the struggles to implement OH initiatives (1b); and 2) the need to restructure how researchers are evaluated and rewarded within academic institutions (2\\u202fm). Although the first solution seems easy to implement, meaningful results would only be generated if there is a change in behaviour, in which policy makers increase their support for OH. The second solution is clearly a challenging suggestion, since that would imply changing the way the academic and scientific community is structured for many years, which can face a lot of resistance from the stakeholders involved. 3.3.2 Solutions for improving execution The solutions proposed for the execution challenges focus on the following themes: improving OH (integrated) surveillance; and enhancing multi-actor, multi-domain, and multi-level collaborations (see Table 5 ). The solutions proposed for improving OH surveillance focus mainly on enhancing the integration and sharing of surveillance data, added to capacity building of infrastructure and human resources. In this group, only for the suggestion of improving laboratory and operational capacities for OH surveillance (3j) no implemented example was identified; indicating that capacity building in OH surveillance, although important, has been extremely challenging. Improvements to the number and quality of OH facilitators, who can promote better collaboration, communication, and coordination between stakeholders, were mentioned as an important solution for all three levels of collaborations. For improving multi-actor collaborations, the identified solutions mainly propose the improvement of superficial collaborations by overcoming silo thinking through the support and facilitation of knowledge co-creation among actors. Solutions for multi-domain collaborations aim at creating engagement and trust among actors from all relevant sectors and domains. Still, two of the proposed solutions in this group appear to be challenging for implementation: 1) the need to ensure that actors first find consensus within their own domain before collaborating across domains (5c); and 2) establishing skilled OH leaders and facilitators (5\\u202fh). Similar to the case of surveillance, this last recommended solution highlights the difficulty in implementing strategies focused on capacity building for OH, not only at a structural level, but also in a human capacity level. Specific for multi-level collaborations, solutions were proposed in a much more managerial and governance level, therefore the engagement of national and international policy-makers is perceived as essential [18,22,43,57,64]. One solution in this group that was only recommended was the suggestion to use top-down governance mechanisms to steward OH initiatives (6\\u202fg). An explanation for that can be that the most common way of implementing and stewarding health related interventions is through a top-down approach; the opposite approach (bottom-up) might be seen as more innovative and therefore worthy of mentioning. 3.3.3 Solutions for improving monitoring & evaluation The solutions proposed for improving OH monitoring and evaluation aim at generating reliable evidence on the benefits of performing OH initiatives (see Table 6 ). The solutions proposed for improving OH monitoring and evaluation elaborate on different gaps on the existing evidence on OH outcomes: the absence of studies and guidelines for OH monitoring and evaluation, and the need of developing holistic OH metrics and indicators that account for both quantitative and qualitative aspects. Within this group, only one solution was not accompanied by an example of implementation: the establishment of a network of experts to develop evaluation protocols for OH (7b). Although a proof-of-principle for this solution was not provided, it might be an interesting approach to try as an attempt to improve OH monitoring and evaluation. 3.4 Solutions at a multi-level perspective The solutions were also plotted in the framework of the causal tree of challenges (see Fig. A.2 in the Appendix) in order to visualize how they relate to the causal line of argumentation. In fact, the causal tree (displayed in Figs. 2 and A.1) is essential to understand why and how interventions and solutions may or may not work. Since more tangible challenges are at the top of the tree, solutions that focus on these rows tend to be superficial, targeting symptoms rather than the real causes. On the other hand, solutions focused on the bottom rows of the tree tend to be hard to implement, since they tackle fundamental problems embedded in institutions and systems. It follows that most of the solutions for which no examples of successful implementation (i.e. recommended solutions) were provided, were located either at the very beginning (1b and 7b) or at the very end (2\\u202fm, 3j, 5\\u202fh and 6\\u202fg) of the tree. Tackling causes in the middle of the causal tree tends to be easier and therefore more implemented examples were provided. In addition, adopting solutions that address a cause for multiple symptomatic challenges is also beneficial, since it can solve several challenges at once, having the potential to generate faster results [66]. Furthermore, even if the papers mentioned solutions that were successfully implemented, those usually occurred on a small-scale and in specific contexts. Moreover, although a solution worked in a specific context, it did not solve all the challenges that the specific OH initiative was facing; most papers still described enduring challenges even after the solutions were implemented. These enduring challenges were usually related to a different theme, and sometimes even phase, from the one that the implemented solution addressed. This confirms the interdependency of challenges, which indicates that in order to successfully implement OH initiatives, a range of solutions need to be considered to tackle simultaneously the different themes pertaining to the different process phases. The frequency in which the included papers mentioned specific solutions was also assessed. The majority of papers propose solutions at the phase of execution, followed by the conditions for starting and finally the monitoring and evaluation phase. In relation to the thematic classification of challenges, most papers mentioned solutions related to the theme of multi-actor collaborations (n\\u202f=\\u202f39), followed policy and funding (n\\u202f=\\u202f29). Closely mentioned were the themes of multi-domain collaborations (n\\u202f=\\u202f28) and multi-level collaborations (n\\u202f=\\u202f26). The next most mentioned themes were education and training (n\\u202f=\\u202f25) followed by surveillance (n\\u202f=\\u202f22). Solutions for the theme of evidence were least mentioned (n\\u202f=\\u202f17). 4 Discussion In this paper, we showed that a variety of challenges endured by OH initiatives affect their performance in different process phases and across different themes. The causal analysis revealed that challenges are interconnected through overlapping causes, crosscutting causal relations and even direct links, emphasizing the need for integrative approaches as the OH. The striking majority of mentioned challenges related to problems in the collaboration between the different stakeholders. The root causes for all types of challenges are at the institutional and systemic level, and they relate to two different fragmentations: either the institutional-academic (e.g. professional and organizational silos), or the geographic-cultural (e.g. diverse preferences, values and capacity). Still, many solutions are proposed for tackling the challenges in performing OH initiatives and, for most of these solutions, practical examples of implementation were described. However, even for the challenges of which examples of implemented solutions were described, the initiatives still faced persistent challenges to be addressed in the different phases and themes. The biggest knowledge gap, in terms of proposed solutions for overcoming the challenges endured by OH initiatives, was notably for performing monitoring and evaluation. A key finding from the causal analysis is that challenges and their causes are interrelated across phases and themes. While the lack of conditions (policy and funding, and education and training) causes difficulties in the execution of OH initiatives, a poor execution is a cause for the difficulties in producing OH evidence; as monitoring and evaluation is better performed when planned already during the design and execution phases. Furthermore, the lack of evidence on the benefits of performing OH initiatives is a cause for the lack of conditions, since to guarantee policy support and funding, evidence about the benefits of performing the OH approach needs to be provided. In addition, the process phases for performing OH initiatives, hereby delineated, do not happen in a demarcated and unrelated fashion, but rather in an interactive and iterative way. Creating the necessary conditions, for instance, is important not only for boosting the start of initiatives but should be a constant effort in place throughout the whole process and at different levels. For instance, relevant competences by practitioners, and methodological principles at project level are essential conditions for starting the project; still, conditions in the institutional context (organizational flexibility) and correlations with the wider societal context (community engagement and consideration of local context) are essential for generating intended changes. Therefore, efforts have to be made simultaneously to create conditions at project level, and to achieve embedding and support at institutional level [16]. Although this may be true, this paper showed that projects are still initiated and executed even when conditions are not completely present [16]. In fact, even without conducive institutional and cultural conditions at the system level, experiments and initiatives happen. However, under this lack of proper conditions, practitioners struggle with enduring barriers for the implementation and scaling-up of such projects, as demonstrated in this paper for OH initiatives. This unclear delineation of challenges across categories also applies to their classification in themes. Albeit the thematic classification of challenges has been broadly used by different fields of integrative approaches [68,70–74], it does not reflect how challenges work in practice. This finding also affects the strategic implementation of solutions. Although many examples of implemented solutions were identified, they did not address all problems faced by the described OH initiatives, most authors reflected in their papers on enduring problems on the overall performance of the OH approach. To improve the performance of OH initiatives, a range of solutions should be implemented to tackle simultaneously challenges at the different phases and from different themes. The surveillance of zoonotic diseases, for instance, could benefit significantly from the OH approach, through the integration of data and analysis from human, veterinary and environmental domains. Nevertheless, difficulties in collaboration between these actors lead to inefficiencies in data sharing, integration and collective analysis [30,40,54,55]. Therefore, solutions should focus at the same time on improving the standardization and integration of surveillance data through the enhanced collaboration of relevant stakeholders across domains. Other authors similarly claimed that neglecting the interconnection between different thematic aspects (such as epistemic, regulatory, and practical aspects) can generate inefficiencies in the execution of projects [69]. Not surprisingly, among the manifold challenges endured by OH initiatives that persist in different phases and relate to different themes, this paper shows that challenges for promoting collaboration between the wide diversity of stakeholders, as a fundamental aspect in the OH approach, are by far the most mentioned in the literature. Collaboration challenges are also recognized in collaborative approaches from other ID and TD fields as transition management [70–72], and resilience thinking [75–77]. The emergence of the OH approach challenged the pre-conception that global health problems could be solved through insights from experts working exclusively within their own discipline, proposing a multidisciplinary engagement of stakeholders [69]. However, as showed in the collaboration challenges, the difficulties in promoting real and equal participation from diverse actors persists. The intended innovation proposed by the OH approach, necessary to solve global health challenges, will only occur when stakeholders manage to overcome their professional and cultural silos to work together and therefore generate the co-creation of new knowledge, methodologies and practices [17,25,47,61]. Multi-level collaborations are also problematic, since they request the engagement of policy-makers and international organizations, who tend to interpret the scope of OH within the context of their mandate and activities. Their reluctance to broaden their vision and scope affects the wider acceptance and implementation of collaborative approaches as OH. In this context, some authors argue that this conservative attitude at a preeminent level influences the performance of mainstream OH initiatives, because practitioners tend to reproduce the narrowed pursue of specific goals with the prioritization of self-interests, leading to reductionism and fragmentation [22]. Notably, the root causes not only for collaboration, but all types of challenges are embedded in two different types of institutional and systemic fragmentations. Firstly, institutional-academic fragmentation is reflected on disciplinary and organizational silos, with each institution having specific working practices and methods. Secondly, the geographic-cultural fragmentation is reflected in diverse social and cultural preferences, values and even disparities in knowledge and capacity; which is particularly, but not exclusively, evident in institutions from developed nations adjacent to developing countries. Building upon similar root causes found in the fields of OH data sharing [78] and rabies innovation [14], this study elaborates on fundamental challenges that generate persistent and complex problems for OH initiatives. Recognizing that the search strategy for including papers in this review focused on identifying challenges for designing and implementing OH initiatives, this review does not provide an exhaustive overview of successfully implemented OH initiatives. Still, the striking majority of the included papers either proposed or discussed solutions to address challenges, and even described examples implemented in practice. Interestingly, most of the solutions for which no example of implementation was found were located either at the beginning or the end of the causal tree. This reflects the logic of the fundamentality of the different challenges and their causes, solutions at the middle level have a focus on local and immediate problems, being easier to implement with the potential for generating faster results. Still, several solutions were implemented at the bottom level. Solutions proposed for the bottom (systemic) level aim at the root causes of the OH challenges, having the potential to generate long-term and sustainable results. Nevertheless, individual OH practitioners can do little in influencing the adoption and implementation of solutions at this institutional and systemic level. Hence, the organization of OH practitioners (e.g. in projects or networks) and engagement of policy-makers, international organizations, and community members are essential preconditions for supporting solutions that propose deeper institutional and cultural changes. Finally, a mismatch was noticed in terms of most mentioned challenges and proposed solutions. This is especially the case for the challenges under the themes of multi-level collaborations, and evidence. Few papers mentioned specific challenges for multi-level collaborations, however, several papers proposed solutions to address these challenges. As aforementioned, a possible reason for that is the preference for solutions that can cause deeper and sustained changes (at a systemic level), even if they are hard to implement. The opposite happened for the challenges in monitoring and evaluating OH initiatives, where the biggest gap in the literature in terms of proposed solutions was identified. The adoption of the OH approach is unlikely to increase unless a clear sign of its benefits is provided. Therefore, solving these challenges represents the “unfinished agenda” of OH, in the sense that future studies need to be performed aiming to develop a framework for better monitoring and evaluating OH initiatives. 5 Conclusion This paper indicates that many challenges exist and persist for designing and implementing OH initiatives. Although many solutions have been proposed, they were mostly implemented in a small scale and within a specific context. The success of the OH approach does not rely exclusively upon efforts within local initiatives, but also upon changes in cultural, social and institutional practices, at an institutionalized and systemic level [79–81]. In addition, in order to generate a paradigm shift for solving global health problems, a merely multidisciplinary team of experts is not sufficient. Stakeholders should work at an ID and TD level through the integration of academic and ‘real world’ expertise for knowledge co-creation to address OH challenges in an innovative way. Based on the acknowledgement of possible challenges endured by the OH approach and proposed solutions for these challenges, OH practitioners are able to plan and structure the designing and implementation of OH initiatives in a more successful way, by avoiding barriers and/or through the strategic pre-consideration of solutions. Nevertheless, a knowledge gap was identified for solutions proposed to solve challenges in monitoring and evaluating OH initiatives. Future research should focus on this theme in order to provide clear evidence on benefits of using the OH approach. Declaration of interest The authors declare no conflict of interest.

Participants suggested a framework for practicing OH in the Caribbean that emphasized capacity building and sustainability. OH in the ID sense with the inclusion of veterinary, medical and environmental sciences Caribbean countries Zoonosis [62] Wolf This essay locates the one health discussion on disease ecologies in a more than human world within recent developments in cultural and medical anthropology that focus on the entanglements between health and a multitude of animals, plants or microbes, as they are characteristic of a globalized modernity. The paper aims to examine the social dimensions of human–animal-disease-interactions, claiming that disease is a biocultural phenomenon and that social factors generally play a crucial role in the emergence, spread and management of (infectious) disease. OH in the TD sense, with the involvement of actors beyond the academic domain Non-geographically located OH in itself [65] Yates-Doerr This article, through its descriptions of the contingencies scientists face when producing edibility, suggests that “the global,” at least when it comes to food security, cannot be a singular thing and thus cannot be addressed by a universal approach or commonly shared solution. One World One Health in the ID sense, with the involvement of human, animal and environmental sciences Non-geographically located Food security [64] Zinsstag, Schelling, Waltner-Toews & Tanner This paper firstly recalls briefly the history of integrative thinking on human and animal health, secondly it reviews “one medicine” and “ecosystem approaches to health” in the conceptual landscape of comparable and neighbouring approaches, and thirdly it explores avenues of systemic approaches to the health of animal and humans and their potential to address the challenges ahead. OH in the TD sense, with the involvement of actors beyond the academic domain Non-geographically located OH in itself Fig. A.1 Causal tree of challenges. The causal relations between challenges for performing OH initiatives are depicted through the representation of the logical structure of causal arguments [15]. Challenges are broadly classified in process phases (conditions for starting, execution and monitoring and evaluation), and grouped in themes (policy and funding, education and training, surveillance, multi-domain collaborations, multi-actor collaboration, multi-level collaborations, and evidence). Fig. A.1 Fig. A.2 Solutions mapped to the causal tree. The mapping of solutions on the causal tree reveals which challenges specific solutions aim to address (according to Figs. 2 and A.1): symptomatic/superficial challenges, on the top; or fundamental/systemic challenges on the bottom. In this sense, solutions at the middle of the causal tree (in-between dotted lines) have a focus on local and immediate problems, being easier to implement with the potential for generating faster results. Solutions are also mapped in relation to the different process phases and themes. Fig. A.2 References [1] O.H. Initiative About the One Health Initiative 2015 [2] S. Bidaisee C.N.

Fig. 1 Flowchart depicting the multi-step process for assessing spatial and temporal snag hazard in post-fire environments. Open shapes represent spatial data layers and shaded shapes are modeling sub-routines. Fig. 2 A map depicting the location of the six fires used in our analysis that burned primarily in ponderosa pine and dry mixed conifer forests in Oregon’s eastern Cascade Mountains. Fig. 3 The snag hazard-rating matrix based on median snag height and snag density. The median snag density across the six fires used in our analysis was 30 snags ha−1, with a median height of 13.9\\u202fm. We built the rating system from those values, assuming they represent acceptable conditions in fire management. Fig. 4 Probability of snag fall and fragmentation by species for three different DBH snags (20\\u202fcm, 40\\u202fcm, and 80\\u202fcm DBH). Higher slopes represent an increase in risk of injury or death from snag fall or fragmentation. The plus sign was placed at a 0.5 probability and 24\\u202fyears post-fire for reference. 24\\u202fyears was the oldest sample year in this chronosequence, although we project to 50\\u202fyears. Fig. 5 Summary of snag characteristics and hazard by severity class. We present median snag density and height, and first and third quartiles for variability, because of the skewed distribution of these data sets. Fig. 6 Temporal trends in snag hazard for six fires represented as the proportion of landscapes in each of the hazard rating classes. Fig. 7 Spatial and temporal change in snag hazard for the 2003 B&B Complex. The first panel depicts fire severity while the remaining depict snag hazard at increasing time since fire. The decadal period of highest hazard was between 10 and 20- years, although significant hazard persists through 30\\u202fyears following high-severity fire. Fig. 8 Maximum patch size of combined severe and extreme snag hazard for each fire modeled across a 50-year modeling horizon, depicted as absolute size and proportion of the landscape.

Abstract Researchers and managers increasingly recognize enterprise risk management as critical to addressing contemporary fire management challenges. Quantitative wildfire risk assessments contribute by parsing and mapping potentially contradictory positive and negative fire effects. However, these assessments disregard risks to fire responders because they only address social and ecological resources and assets. In this study, we begin to overcome this deficiency by using a novel modeling approach that integrates remote sensing, field inventories, imputation-based vegetation modeling, and empirical models to quantify post-fire snag hazard in space and time. Snag hazard increased significantly immediately post-fire, with severe or extreme hazard conditions accounting for 47%, 83%, and 91% of areas burned at low, moderate and high-severity fire, respectively. Patch-size of severe or extreme hazard positively correlated with fire size, exceeding >20,000\\u202fha (60% of our largest fire) 10-years post-fire when reburn becomes more likely. After 10\\u202fyears, snag hazard declined rapidly as snags fell or fragmented, but severe or extreme hazard persisted for 20, 30 and 35\\u202fyears in portions of the low, moderate and high-severity fire areas. Because forests are denser and wildfires burn with greater severity than historically, these hazardous conditions may represent novel management challenges where risk of injury or death to responders outweighs the benefits of directly engaging the fire. Mapping snag hazard with our methodology could improve situational awareness for both decision makers and fire responders as they mitigate risk during fire management. However, as more landscapes burn we anticipate increased responder exposure to extremely hazardous conditions, which may further entrench the wildfire paradox as fire managers weigh current response decisions with future challenges. Aligning land management objectives with wildfire management needs, in part by mapping responder exposure to snags and other hazards, could help overcome the wildfire paradox and produce desirable long-term outcomes. This research also demonstrates the importance of interdisciplinary collaboration to account for risk to all aspects of fire prone social-ecological systems as we learn to live with fire in rapidly changing environments.

Despite these challenges, there is increasing consensus that more of the “right” kind of fire, at the “right” place, and “right” time is necessary to reduce long-term wildfire risk (Moritz et al., 2014; North et al., 2015). Recent fires can reduce the occurrence (Parks et al., 2016), spread (Collins et al., 2009; Parks et al., 2015), and severity (Parks et al., 2014; Larson et al., 2013) of subsequent fires. These fires can also improve the efficiency of suppression operations in some ecosystems (Thompson et al., 2016a, 2016b). However, little information exists regarding the impacts of contemporary fires on responder exposure to future hazards, despite their critical role in realizing wildfire benefits. Researchers and managers are leveraging technology to create new tools that support wildfire risk management before and during an incident (O’Connor et al., 2016; Dunn et al., 2017b). Quantitative wildfire risk assessments are increasingly integrated into land and fire management across the western U.S. (Calkin et al., 2010; Scott et al., 2013). One limitation to these risk assessments is their focus on social and ecological resources, forcing incident management teams to assess operational risks during a high pressure and time constrained decision environment (Thompson and Calkin, 2011). Fortunately, there are emerging tools that directly support responder safety (notably focused on exposure to the fire itself) in advance of an incident, including mapping suppression difficulty index (Rodriguez y Silva et al., 2014), potential control locations (O’Connor et al., 2017), escape routes (Campbell et al., 2017), and safety zones (Butler, 2014). Including assessments of risk to fire-responders from the multitude of hazards they encounter would further support response decisions, as well as the development of long-term risk reduction strategies. Tree death is an important ecological process and one of the most evident consequences of contemporary forest fires (Franklin et al., 1987; Reilly and Spies, 2015). Coarse woody debris functions as a long-term nutrient and carbon store, a primary energy source for saprophyte communities, and a contributor to long-term soil development (Harmon et al., 1986, Tinker and Knight, 2000). Snags and logs are also critical habitat components for a variety of fauna species (Bull et al., 1997; Thomas et al., 1979), especially in dynamic early seral environments (Swanson et al., 2010; Dunn and Bailey, 2012). Despite these positive benefits, hazardous trees and snags remain one of the leading causes of fire responder injury or death (National Interagency Fire Center, 2018), and disturbances creating an abundance of snags exacerbates this potential (Page et al., 2013). Therefore, quantifying snag hazard in post-fire environments, and developing decision support tools (e.g. maps) that account for spatial and temporal variation in this hazard, are important steps towards balancing ecological needs with safe and effective wildfire response. In this study, we quantify snag hazard for 50\\u202fyears across recently burned landscapes as part of our broader effort to address responder exposure to hazards. We employ a novel modeling approach that integrates remote-sensing, field inventories, imputation based vegetation modeling, and recently developed statistical models of tree mortality and snag dynamics to combine emerging ecological knowledge with risk management science. Our objective is to quantify snag hazard following fire disturbance in both space and time, and describe the anticipated impacts that elevated snag hazards may have on wildfire management strategies and tactics when these landscapes burn again. 2 Methods Quantifying and mapping post-fire snag hazard is a multi-step process integrating several datasets and empirical models. Fig. 1 provides a visualization of the sequence of methods described detail in the following paragraphs. Spatially explicit pre-fire tree lists provide the basis for estimating the abundance, size and species of trees that may become snags. A tree mortality model, derived from correlations between individual tree characteristics and the relative differenced Normalized Burn Ratio (RdNBR) (Miller and Thode, 2007), estimates fire effects to create post-fire snag lists. Subsequently, we use a snag dynamics model (snag fall and fragmentation) to capture change across space and time. Lastly, we apply a hazard rating to the snag conditions across the entire spatial and temporal datasets to simplify and rank them in accordance with potential impacts to fire responders. 2.1 Study area This study focused on fires that primarily burned ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa subsp. ponderosa) and dry-mixed conifer forests along the eastern slopes of the Cascade Mountains in Oregon, USA (Fig. 2 ). Warm dry summers and cold winters characterize the climate, with precipitation falling mostly as snow. Ponderosa pine was the dominant disturbance-mediated overstory species at lower elevations with increasing abundance of shade-tolerant species at higher elevations. Euro-American colonization altered fire regimes and instituted management practices that increased the abundance of shade-tolerant grand or white fir (Abies grandis var. idahoensis and Abies concolor var. lowiana) and Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii var. glauca) across both forest types beginning in the late 19th Century (Merschel et al., 2014; Johnston, 2017; Johnston et al., 2018). Douglas-fir, western larch (Larix occidentalis Nutt.), lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta subsp. murrayana) and incense-cedar (Calocedrus decurrens Torr.) are more common in dry-mixed conifer stands with Douglas-fir and grand fir increasing in dominance at upper elevations. We focused on six fires to capture a diversity of fire size and burn severity patterns: 2002 Eyerly, 2002 Cache Mountain, 2003 B&B Complex, 2003 Davis Lake, 2006 Black Crater, and 2007 GW fires (Table 1 ). 2.2 Spatially explicit tree and snag data We used predictive maps of pre-fire species composition and forest structure created using the gradient nearest neighbor (GNN) method (Ohmann and Gregory 2002). Maps were obtained from the LEMMA group at Oregon State University and the Pacific Northwest Research Station (https://lemma.forestry.oregonstate.edu/). GNN is a predictive nearest neighbor imputation method that uses field inventory data to develop relationships between vegetation structure, multiple spectral indices (e.g. brightness, greenness, wetness), and gridded data on topography and climate. The LEMMA group used this process to produce annualized Landsat TM time-series maps from 1984 to 2010 at 30\\u202fm resolution. For this analysis imputation was based on Euclidian distance in multivariate space derived from Canonical Correspondence Analysis (CCA) (after Ter Braak, 1986), a direct ordination technique. GNN data has been applied to broad-scale vegetation mapping across a wide range of forest ecosystems for multiple objectives (e.g. Ohmann et al., 2012, Davis et al., 2015, Reilly et al., 2018). Complete details on the GNN mapping method are available in Ohmann et al. (2012). 2.3 Fire severity and mortality models We extracted burn severity maps for the six fires from a mosaicked set of Landsat TM images from 1984 to 2011 processed using the Landtrendr algorithm (Kennedy et al., 2010; Reilly et al., 2017). Landtrendr is a temporal and spatial normalization process using a segmentation algorithm to smooth spectral reflectance of individual pixels through time. This process removes noise associated with variability in atmospheric or phenological conditions common in Landsat scenes with different Julian dates. The normalized image stacks were mosaicked to annual composite normalized burn ratio (NBR) grids and we calculated RdNBR for each year using pre-fire (year −1) and post-fire (year\\u202f+\\u202f1) to ensure Landsat scenes represented an image before and after the fire event. We developed individual tree mortality models for 21 tree species in response to a fire severity gradient. Our sample included 21,513 trees from 304 plots with pre- and post-fire field observations from the Current Vegetation Survey (CVS) inventory of USDA Forest Service Region 6 (Table 2 ). The CVS is a systematic regional inventory administered by the USDA Forest Service in Oregon and Washington with the first measurement from 1992 to 1997 and the second from 1997 to 2007 (Max et al., 1996). Field crews sampled these plots at various times pre- and post-fire, so we only used plots with no evidence of a disturbance (except the fire of interest) after the initial plot measurement based on field notes and visual inspection of spectral trajectories from the LandTrendr algorithm described above. We attributed plots, and therefore trees, with a fire severity class based on RdNBR and published fire severity thresholds where <25%, 25–75%, >75% basal area mortality were delineated by the RdNBR thresholds where low = <235, moderate\\u202f=\\u202f235–649, and high\\u202f=\\u202f≥649 severity (Reilly et al., 2017). 2.3.1 Probability of mortality We estimated the probability of mortality of individual trees using a generalized linear mixed model with a binomial distribution and logit link function. Plot was included as a random effect to account for positive correlations in residuals resulting from spatial autocorrelation of individual trees within plots. We analyzed each species independently and included diameter at breast height (DBH), severity class, and the number of years between the fire and post-fire sample year as fixed-effects. We also tested 2-way interactions among these variables. We report all 21 species we had enough data for even if they were not present in our study area. We conducted these analyses using the lme4 package in R v 3.1.1 (Bates et al., 2015, R Development Core Team, 2014). 2.4 Temporal snag dynamics We use an existing database of post-fire snags from a 24-year chronosequence and the NecroDynamics model to capture snag fall and fragmentation (Dunn and Bailey, 2015). However, we updated the model by substituting continuous DBH data for DBH classes (Dunn and Bailey, 2012). We estimated the probability of snag fall and snag fragmentation from 6055 and 4458 individual sample records, respectively. We used a generalized linear mixed model with characteristics identical to those described in our mortality model. Although analyzed on continuous data, we present results for three different snag sizes to simplify our presentation of results regarding the effects of DBH and time on snag dynamics. We used our updated statistical estimates and the NecroDynamics model to quantify changes in snag conditions across a 50-year modeling horizon. We only had estimates of snag dynamics for ponderosa pine, Douglas-fir, grand/white fir, and lodgepole pine so we coerced all other species into one of these four species based on similarities in physical characteristics and wood density. We modeled all true firs, Calocedrus decurrens (incense-cedar), Thuja plicata (western redcedar) and Larix occidentalis (western larch) using grand/white fir estimates, hardwoods, Pinus albicaulis (whitebark pine) and Tsuga mertensiana (mountain hemlock) with lodgepole pine estimates, and Pinus monticola (western white pine) using ponderosa pine estimates. We assume snag dynamics were consistent across post-fire topographic conditions, and use the same fall and fragmentation rates for all severity conditions because estimates are not available for lower fire severity classes. We also assume the trends developed from the 24-year chronosequence are relevant to 50\\u202fyears since we currently lack estimates extending that far into the future. 2.5 Snag hazard We were interested in developing a hazard rating system to simplify pixel-level conditions across the post-fire landscapes. To date, no quantitative measure of snag hazard exists so field personnel evaluate hazardous trees during fire management operations. Therefore, we develop our methodology from the authors firefighting experience, consultation with current responders, and field plots of current forest conditions. We focus on snags ≥20\\u202fcm DBH and derive our hazard rating from snag height (potential reach) and density because these variables directly influence the probability of a snag striking a fire responder. We estimated pre-fire median snag density and height from all 2411 different plots, weighted by their abundance across all six landscapes, as the typical operating environment that sets the threshold of acceptable risk by fire responders. We used medians instead of means as our measure of central tendency to reduce the influence of plots from the 2003 B&B Complex and 2007 GW fires impacted by western spruce budworm (Choristoneura occidentalis Freeman) where tree mortality may have resulted in snag densities exceeding the typical operating environment. Pre-fire median snag density was 30 snags ha−1 and median height was 13.9\\u202fm for snags >20\\u202fcm DBH. We expanded the hazard-rating matrix from these estimates and categorized pixel-level snag conditions into one of four hazard categories with a nomenclature following the Department of Homeland Security rating system (Fig. 3 ). We attributed our spatial and temporal datasets with the hazard rating and report summary statistics by fire severity class and incident. We created post-fire snag lists by applying our mortality model to pre-fire tree lists, imputed using the GNN method, at each pixel within the burned landscape. Each tree within the pre-fire tree list was subject to mortality based on the pixels RdNBR value and individual tree attributes as per our mortality model. This creates post-fire snag lists for each pixel across the landscape that change with time based on our snag dynamics results. Then we attributed each pixel, for each year of analysis, with the appropriate snag hazard rating based on their snag density and height. We extracted snag density, median snag height and the hazard rating from each pixel across the six-burned landscapes by severity class, for each year of modeling, to quantify temporal variation in snag hazard associated with fire severity. We then quantified the median snag density and median snag height, as well as the first and third quartiles, and the proportion of pixels in each of the four hazard ratings for the entire dataset. Then we calculated proportion in each severity class by fire incident to evaluate differences at the fire scale. We also quantified absolute maximum patch size for severe and extreme conditions combined, as well as the proportion of total burned area consisting of these two most severe hazard classes. We did this on an annual basis across the 50-year modeling horizon for each incident using ClassStats function in the SDMTools package in R (VanDerWal et al., 2014). We combined these hazard ratings because they both represent enough risk to fire responders that they warrant alternative engagement strategies or tactics. 3 Results 3.1 Probability of mortality We were able to create statistical models estimating the probability of mortality for 21 species of conifer and hardwoods trees found in the Pacific Northwest. Table 3 contains the statistical models and significance of covariates for each species. We also include three figures as online supplemental material depicting the response of fire-tolerant, fire-intolerant and hardwood trees by severity class across their observed DBH range. As expected, the probability of mortality increased with increasing fire severity for all species, but the magnitude of difference by fire-severity class and relationships with DBH varied by species. Our analysis indicates a decreasing probability of mortality with increasing DBH for species commonly considered fire-tolerant, including Douglas-fir, ponderosa pine, western larch, sugar pine and white fir. The only exception was incense-cedar where DBH did not have a statistical correlation with probability of mortality (Table 3). We considered white fir to be fire tolerant because it develops thick bark in this region, especially at larger diameters. Hardwood species had a similar response, but generally exhibited a higher likelihood of mortality than fire-tolerant conifers. An interaction term between DBH and fire severity was statistically significant for Douglas-fir and ponderosa pine, indicating different response slopes. Additionally, we observed a statistically significant relationship with the number of years post-fire when re-measurement occurred, indicating delayed mortality for Douglas-fir, canyon live oak, and tanoak. For modeling purposes, we attribute tree mortality up to 10-years post-fire (or maximum number of years sampled post-fire, whichever is smaller) as fire-related and capture them in our models when quantifying tree mortality across the burned landscapes. In contrast, the majority of species commonly considered fire-intolerant did not exhibit statistically significant correlation with DBH, suggesting they do not develop increased fire tolerance with increasing size (Table 3). The exceptions were grand fir, lodgepole pine and western hemlock. Unexpectedly, grand fir estimates were nearly equivalent to white fir, a species commonly thought to be more fire-tolerant, which may be a function of hybridization in our study area. These fire-intolerant species exhibit higher likelihood of mortality in all severity classes, with zero or few individuals surviving high-severity fire. In many cases, the differences between fire severity classes were low as indicated by overlapping error bars (see online supplemental material). Only western redcedar had a statistically significant relationship with the number of years post-fire when re-measurement occurred, suggesting they too exhibit measureable delayed mortality that is accounted for in our modeling as described previously. 3.2 Temporal snag dynamics The cumulative probability of snag fall increased with the number of years-since-fire, and varied by species and DBH (Table 4 ). Larger snags were more likely to remain standing than smaller snags across all species, with Douglas-fir having the lowest probability of falling (Fig. 4 ). The interaction term between species and years-since-fire was statistically significant as the slopes of the trend lines varied. Half-life estimates (i.e. year when 50% of the snag population has fallen) provide a metric for comparing fall rates across populations of interest and among studies. Half-lives for small ponderosa pine snags (20\\u202fcm DBH) were 9–10\\u202fyears, medium snags (40\\u202fcm DBH) were 13–14\\u202fyears, and large snags (80\\u202fcm DBH) were 22–23\\u202fyears. Half-lives for small lodgepole pine snags were 8–9\\u202fyears and 10–11\\u202fyears for small and medium snags, respectively. We did not encounter large lodgepole pine snags in our sample. Half-lives for small grand/white fir snags were 11–12\\u202fyears, medium snags were 14–15\\u202fyears, and large snags were 21–22\\u202fyears. Lastly, half-lives for small Douglas-fir snags were 16–17\\u202fyears, medium snags were 21–22\\u202fyears, and large snags were 31–32\\u202fyears. Table 4 provides coefficients for the significant predictor variables and random error terms for estimating the cumulative probability of fallen snags on the logit scale. The plot random error term was statistically significant, indicating additional environmental effects influence snag fall at that scale (e.g. wind events). The cumulative probability of snag fragmentation increased with time-since-fire, but varied by species and DBH. We also observed an interaction between DBH and species (Table 4). In general, the relationship with DBH and time was opposite that for fall rates as larger snags were more likely to fragment. However, we observed little variation by diameter for lodgepole and ponderosa pine. Ponderosa pine generally had the highest fragmentation rates with exception of the large grand/white fir that also fragmented rapidly (Fig. 4). The majority of smaller DBH snags fell before fragmenting. Table 4 provides coefficients for the significant predictor variables and random error terms for estimating the cumulative probability of snags with broken tops on the logit scale. We estimated changes in snag height over time from the same data and included in the NecroDynamics model. We encourage those interested in more details regarding snag dynamics to review Dunn and Bailey (2012, 2015). 3.3 Snag hazard We observed a positive relationship between fire severity and median snag density and height as more and larger trees were killed (Fig. 5 ). Median snag density (1st and 3rd quartile) was 38 (14, 90), 127 (69, 215) and 241 (153, 383) snags ha−1 immediately following low, moderate and high-severity fire, respectively. Median snag height was 16.1 (12.8, 19.8), 17.4 (14.1, 20.4), and 18.6 (16.0, 21.3) immediately following low, moderate and high-severity fire, respectively. These snag conditions resulted in an increasing proportion of higher hazard ratings as fire severity increased. For low-severity fire areas, 29%, 18%, 14% and 39% had a hazard rating of extreme, severe, elevated and guarded, respectively. Following moderate-severity fire, 66%, 17%, 6% and 10% had a hazard rating of extreme, severe, elevated and guarded, respectively. After high-severity fire, 86%, 5%, 3% and 6% had a hazard rating of extreme, severe, elevated and guarded, respectively. As fire severity increased so too did the time that severe and extreme hazard conditions persisted. Low-severity fire areas retained some severe and extreme conditions for up to 20\\u202fyears, moderate-severity up to 30\\u202fyears, and high-severity up to 35\\u202fyears. It is also important to note that the rapid decline in snag abundance began around 10\\u202fyears post-fire and lasted until 20 to 25\\u202fyears post-fire depending on fire severity (Fig. 4). This represents the period of highest risk directly attributed to snag fall and fragmentation, exclusive of the effects of burning again which would accelerate fall or fragmentation. The spatial and temporal variation in snag hazard across fire incidents depends on interactions among fire-severity and pre-fire stand structure (Fig. 6 ). Fires with the largest area and longest duration with a severe or extreme hazard rating were the 2003 B&B Complex and 2003 Davis Lake fires that also had the highest proportion of high-severity fire (Table 1). In contrast, the 2002 Eyerly fire also burned with a high-proportion of high-severity relative to the other fires in our sample, but much of the landscape was non-forested. We included pre-fire estimates of hazard ratings as well, recognizing that fire is not the only disturbances affecting these forests. The effects of western spruce budworms within the 2003 B&B Complex and 2007 GW fires prior to burning are evident in the western portion of their burned area. We include maps of the 2003 B&B Complex to demonstrate temporal and spatial change across a burned landscape (Fig. 7 ). The relationship between fire severity and snag hazard becomes evident later in the time-series. We include additional annual time-series maps of snag hazard for multiple fires as online supplemental material. The characteristics of each incident influenced the absolute patch size of combined severe and extreme hazard, as well as the proportion of burned area covered by that patch. Fire size had the greatest relationship to absolute patch size (Fig. 8 ), amounting to 24,807\\u202fha immediately following the 2003 B&B Complex fire. The B&B Complex’s maximum patch size was 3.75 times that of the second ranked 2003 Davis Lake fire in our sample (B&B Complex was 4.41 times the total extent of the Davis Lake fire). However, fire size was not the only important factor as fire severity, pre-fire forest structure and composition played an important role, particularly concerning temporal trends. For example, the 2003 Davis Lake fire had the highest proportion (0.65) of high-severity fire among all fires investigated. Davis Lakes’ high-severity areas primarily formed as a single contiguous patch that directly translated into the highest single patch of severe or extreme snag hazard (79.1% of the burned area). A review of the pre-fire forest structure and composition showed that much of the Davis Lake high-severity patch burned through old-growth stands with large trees. These snags stand longer (Fig. 4), and combined with the large contiguous patch of high-severity fire, resulted in the Davis Lake fire’s maximum patch size being the most persistent and eventually largest over time (Fig. 8). In contrast, the 2002 Eyerly fire contained significant area of non-forest vegetation, breaking up the patches of severe and extreme snag hazard such that only 24.0% of the burned area was in a single contiguous patch. Immediately following the 2002 Cache Mt. fire with the lowest overall fire severity, only 27.2% of the burned area formed a contiguous patch of severe or extreme snag hazard rating. 4 Discussion In this study, we demonstrated a methodology for characterizing and mapping snag hazard to fire responders in recently disturbed forests (Fig. 1). We were able to map snag hazard across burned landscapes by integrating pre-fire remote-sensing, field inventories, and imputation based vegetation modeling with empirically derived mortality models. Subsequently, we projected the spatial distribution and magnitude of snag hazards into the future using the recently developed NecroDynamics model (Dunn and Bailey, 2015). This process demonstrates how interdisciplinary collaboration can further our adaptation to future fire and climate change, in part by recognizing the importance of the fire management system in addressing these challenges (Thompson et al., 2015; 2018). Our results offer important insights regarding the consequences of dynamic snag hazard on near and long-term wildfire risk. Snag hazard increases significantly in post-fire environments and may be creating novel management challenges not encountered over the past 50+ years. Hazardous fuel, stand densities, and susceptibility of trees to death from fire has increased over the past 100+ years as the consequences of past forest and fire management policies and practices interact with warmer, drier conditions that promote more extreme fire behavior in denser forest environments (Naficy et al., 2010; Stephens et al., 2014; Jolly et al., 2015). Fire severity is higher than observed historically in many forest types, resulting in more and larger diameter snags than encountered when Euro-American colonization altered disturbance regimes with an aggressive fire suppression paradigm (Johnston et al., 2018.) (Fig. 5). High snag densities and larger snags with a greater fall-reach, wider crowns, and greater mass increase responder exposure to this hazard. Larger snags also persist longer on the landscape (Fig. 4), increasing the probability that another ignition will occur within a severe or extreme snag hazard area. Furthermore, the onset of large or mega-fires in recent decades increases the overall extent of burned landscapes (Stephens et al., 2014), including the absolute patch-size of high-severity fire (Reilly et al., 2017; Stevens et al., 2017). Given the relationship between fire size, patch-size, fire severity and snag hazard (Figs. 5 and 8), we are likely to continue to observe an increase in responder exposure to snag hazard into the future. Insect outbreaks (e.g., bark beetles), drought, and other non-fire mortality factors compound these conditions across many forest types (Meddens et al., 2012; McDowell et al., 2015). Snags directly affect safe and effective wildfire response during all stages of incident management. First responders may not be able to engage directly with an ignition because of snags, especially when they are on fire. Burning increases the likelihood that all or a portion of a snag will fall, reducing opportunities to extinguish the fire immediately. Fire responders may have to wait until the burning snag falls before constructing a containment line around it. Accessing the point of ignition may require travel through hazardous areas (Fig. 8), further exposing responders to injury or death. Therefore, pursuing alternative response tactics may be necessary and snag hazard maps could help facilitate more rapid risk-informed decisions. Hazardous snag conditions also affect large fire response strategies and tactics. Desired control lines may fall within a previously burned area with a severe or extreme snag hazard rating. Pursuing a strategy that uses this control line would require extensive hazard mitigation that consumes time and resources while increasing responder exposure. These conditions may also compromise escape routes and safety zones, and increase responder exposure during mop-up since fire weakens snags. In fact, responders often spend extensive time mopping up a fire as much as 90\\u202fm inside a control line, where snags >150\\u202fm inside the control line are a threat. Mapping snag hazard, and overlaying it with potential control locations (O’Connor et al., 2017) could help fire managers make risk-informed strategic response decisions that balance responder exposure with likelihood of containment success. Opportunities to mitigate snag hazard during an incident may be limited across much of the landscape because of an abundance of snags and their felling complexity. Felling snags is more complex than live trees because of uncertainty in holding wood strength, the distribution of weight throughout the snag, and the potential for tops to break during cutting. Exposing responders to this hazard elevates risk of injury or death, leaving avoidance as the less risky mitigation strategy. This could amount to avoiding large portions of a landscape (Fig. 7), particularly after 10\\u202fyears when reburn becomes more likely and snag fall rates increase (Collins et al., 2009; Parks et al., 2015). In fact, our estimates suggest >20,000\\u202fha, or 60% of the burned landscape in our largest sampled fire at 10\\u202fyears post-fire, may have conditions where exposure outweighs the benefits of engagement (Fig. 8). Mapping snag hazard as we have done here improves situational awareness for both decision makers and fire responders during strategic response development and the ensuing tactical response. 4.1 Long-term wildfire risk management Risk management and risk sharing provide important foundational principles and practices for long-term wildfire risk reduction (Dunn et al., 2017a). Risk management (RM) is a set of coordinated processes and activities that identify, assess, monitor, prioritize, and control risks that an organization does or will face. RM considers high-impact to mundane decisions, and spans organizational to individual actions before, during, and after these decisions. RM also involves assessment and planning well in advance of decisions and shares risk management responsibility throughout the organizational structure (Thompson et al., 2016a, 2016b). Implementing such comprehensive wildfire risk management would align land management objectives and actions such that they support wildfire response (Dunn et al., 2017b). This is particularly important since managing the existing wildfire threat and implementing viable mitigation options relies heavily on the fire management system and its ability to overcome the wildfire paradox (Thompson et al., 2015). The wildfire paradox suggests positive feedbacks from negative consequences of wildfires reinforce aggressive suppression, despite this strategy contributing to and perpetuating the existing problem. Until now, the real or perceived negative consequences from wildfires on ecosystem resilience (Stevens-Rumann et al., 2018) and social resources and assets (Charnley et al., 2017) were considered the drivers of the wildfire paradox (Calkin et al., 2015). We have demonstrated that responder exposure to snag hazard may further entrench the wildfire paradox as fire managers consider the negative consequences of large fires on future responder risk, especially in the absence of other remediation. As fires accumulate across landscapes fire responders may be forced to overcome the paradox as recently burned landscapes ignite again and snag hazard leads to a less aggressive initial response to minimize risk, unless political pressure leads to increasingly risky behavior (Canton-Thompson et al., 2008). Fortunately, there are options for proactive management actions with direct and measureable benefits achieved as risk management aligns across land and fire management agencies and activities. Land managers historically addressed hazardous snags in post-fire environments via extensive salvage logging. However, economic, ecological, logistical and administrative constraints limit the spatial extent and locations available for active management (North et al., 2015). From an enterprise risk management perspective, salvage logging also transfers risk from fire responders to timber harvesters, a more hazardous trade (Center for Disease Control and Prevention, 2018), and is a reactive action addressing symptoms rather than root causes. An alternative is targeted treatments along potential control locations (O’Connor et al 2017), which could break up the severe or extreme snag hazard landscape (Fig. 8), supporting safe and effective response by minimizing exposure while reinforcing the most likely large fire containment lines. Proactive management actions can address the root causes of increased snag hazard in post-fire environments. Forest restoration or hazardous fuels reduction reduces tree density and decreases tree mortality by increasing the fire tolerance of residual trees while reducing fire intensity (Agee and Skinner, 2005). These treatments are limited by the same constraints noted previously, so prescribed fire or managing wildfires for resource objectives may be the most effective strategy for achieving these fuels reduction benefits. Wildfires burning during low and moderate fire weather conditions would promote lower severity fire, reducing the abundance and patch-size of severe and extreme snag hazard (Figs. 5 and 8). Prescribed fire and managing wildfires for resource objectives could be extended to the post-fire environment with a burn-the-burn strategy, especially in low- and moderate-severity areas. Doing so could minimize the probability of fire occurrence in high-severity fire areas by inhibiting fires spread into them, while also helping to contain a fire ignited within. Reburning landscapes also reduces snag hazard in the short and long-term by increasing fall rates of existing snags, and preventing the development of forest conditions that exacerbate snag hazard in post-fire environments. Ultimately, aligning land management decisions with more of the “right” kind of fire in the “right” places at the “right” time with the goal of reducing risk to ecosystems and their services, social assets and property, and fire responders will help transition to a new fire management paradigm that produces desirable long-term outcomes in fire-prone landscapes. 4.2 Future needs In this manuscript, we described a methodology for assessing and mapping snag hazards in post-fire environments, and in so doing, discovered new perspectives on the implications of contemporary wildfire effects. However, our research goals are to provide decision support tools that improve the safety and effectiveness of wildfire management. Doing so requires additional research investment and expansion of our methodologies across a broader geographic scale. First, we need to expand our mortality model to include additional species across a variety of ecoregions. The Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) program’s field plots likely meets this need. Second, we need to add to the growing body of literature on post-fire snag dynamics (Grayson et al., 2019) to stratify across additional tree species, topographic positions, and post-fire stand characteristics. These factors contribute to highly variable snag dynamics not well documented (Dunn and Bailey, 2016), and are particularly important for aligning post-fire land management decisions with fire response in the future. Third, our model requires pre-fire tree lists that include species, DBH and height. Riley et al. (2016) have imputed tree lists from FIA field plots across the western U.S., although they used a different methodology than GNN. Lastly, we need to ensure that our hazard rating system is both quantitatively accurate and representative of how snag hazards influence strategic and tactical decisions. We are currently in the process of surveying fire responders across a broad gradient of incident qualifications to refine our hazard rating system. We also recognize the need to integrate additional hazards into a single responder exposure index that is actionable for fire responders and informative for land management decisions. Extending our methodology to other forest disturbances (e.g., drought and insects) would contribute to a more comprehensive assessment of responder exposure to snag hazard (Meddens et al., 2012; McDowell et al., 2015). In addition, snags become logs and heavy accumulation of coarse wood elevates resistance to control by impeding travel, reducing line construction rates, and increasing the difficulty of extinguishing a fire (Page et al., 2013). Lastly, obtaining estimates of reburn impacts on snag demographics would help clarify how alternative response strategies mitigate or exacerbate snag hazard in post-fire environments, so that land and fire management decisions most effectively support long-term risk reduction to fire responders. Expanding research to include these factors requires investment, but minimizing risk of injury or death to fire responders is prudent for an organization focused on enterprise risk management, especially as the fire environment becomes increasingly complex.

Highlights • Explicit instruction grounded in an SFL-based approach to genre led to improved student writing. • Explicit instruction led to consistent use of specialized, discipline-specific words to frame analyses. • Explicit instruction led to effective integration of external resources to set up an argument. Abstract We report on an interdisciplinary collaboration between writing professors with training in linguistics and a design professor at an English-medium university in the Middle East, where the majority of the students have English as an additional language. We briefly describe the iterative process of redesigning the writing assignments and designing writing workshops to make the design professor's expectations more explicit. We then investigate the impact of the explicit instruction and writing workshops on students’ writing. We use a corpus-based tool to compare the writing of students who participated in the workshops to that of students who took the course in a previous semester, when the workshops were not offered. Our analysis points to an improvement in student writing as a result of the disciplinary writing workshops, particularly in the use of linguistic resources to write analytically. Keywords Interdisciplinary collaboration Analytical writing Corpus analysis 1 The importance of writing in design As a field, design is visual and tectonic (Schmalz, 2014). Design professionals are trained as visual artists, using two- and three-dimensional means to depict spaces, objects, and urban environments; they learn to code, sketch, and build physical and digital models; and they explore and examine how design processes can transform everyday experience and effect social change (Schmalz, 2014). In addition to these fundamental skills, strong communication skills are essential for design professionals. For example, design professionals need to be able to develop and defend arguments to convince clients that their real needs will be satisfied by what the designer has to offer (Khoury & Khoury, 2009; Kliment, 2006). However, many professional designers as well as design educators and students are often unaware of the importance of communication skills in design, and few design schools offer training targeting such skills (Kliment, 2006). This presents a serious problem since designers must be able to use language to effectively communicate, articulate, rationalize and defend their designs (Xu, Gilboa, Sayarath, Kabba, & Maeda, 2017). In particular, the need for effective written communication has been increasingly acknowledged by those in the design field. The 2017 Design In Tech Report (Xu et al., 2017) lists writing as a key design skill, and Frankel (2009) finds that designers need to become better at building an argument and using descriptive evidence to support it. In other words, design is no longer a single-skilled profession, and designers need to both cultivate their creativity and develop the ability to write clearly and effectively. In the present study, we, applied linguists with expertise in writing, collaborated with a design professor to scaffold analytical argumentative writing in a design course at an English-medium university in the Middle East. The design professor in this context was adamant about the importance of strong written communication skills for designers, particularly the ability to write analytically and argumentatively. He commented, “There are a lot of designers out there, but the best ones are those who can argue for the power and value of design” (Mitchell & Pessoa, in press). He was concerned that the writing students produced in his course could be stronger. Although he was interested in improving student outcomes, he lacked the explicit knowledge to teach analytical argumentative writing on his own and felt that our expertise would be valuable in helping students not only in his class, but also in preparation for their future professional lives. Although writing was a major component of the design professor's course, initial interactions with him revealed that assignment guidelines needed to be clearer and more explicit in terms of genre and rhetorical features. Thus, we embarked on a collaboration with this professor to unpack his tacit writing expectations, redesign four analytical writing assignments to make expectations clearer, and scaffold student writing through four in-class writing workshops (see Mitchell & Pessoa, in press). In this paper, we briefly describe the iterative process of collaboration with a particular focus on the impact of the revised assignment guidelines and writing workshops on students’ writing by using a corpus-driven tool, DocuScope, to compare the writing of students who participated in the writing workshops to that of students who did not participate in writing workshops. Since in this course we provided explicit writing instruction in a discipline-specific class, we first briefly contextualize our research in the broader context of previous ‘Writing in the disciplines’ (WID) studies that have examined the effects of embedding discipline-specific writing instruction into subject teaching. We then focus particularly on genre-based writing instruction based on Systemic Functional Linguistics (SFL), the approach we used to scaffold student writing. 2 The importance of explicit writing instruction Disciplinary faculty in higher education institutions assign a variety of writing assignments to their students, including lab reports, executive summaries, business plans, case studies, progress reports, company profiles, book reviews, ethnographies, feasibility reports, essay exams, abstracts, annotated bibliographies, editorials, court briefs, company profiles, press releases, literature reviews, etc. (Melzer, 2014). Many of these writing assignments are designed to help students become familiar and fluent with the writing conventions of a given discipline. However, many disciplinary faculty have neither an explicit awareness of their discipline's literacy conventions nor the expertise and meta-language to teach them (Wingate, 2015). Since they lack training in writing pedagogies, they rely on their own writing experiences as former students and professionals in their field to design and assess student writing. This is an area that deserves attention because most university students do the majority of their writing in courses that are taught by disciplinary teachers, not language teachers. Research on writing in the disciplines (WID) has looked at the benefits of embedding discipline-specific writing instruction into subject teaching (e.g., Buzzi, Grimes, & Rolls, 2012; Somerville & Creme, 2005; Wingate, Andon, & Cogo, 2011; Yalvac, Smith, Troy, & Hirsch, 2007). For example, Wingate et al. (2011) developed an online discipline-embedded initiative to help pharmacy students to identify, understand and produce different text genres needed for academic study and professional work. In Yalvac et al. (2007), writing instructors collaborated with engineering disciplinary faculty responsible for the delivery of the discipline's curriculum to scaffold the writing of research papers by upper level undergraduate biomedical engineering students. Overall, collaborations between disciplinary faculty responsible for the delivery of the discipline's curriculum and writing instructors result in improved disciplinary writing. The present study, with its focus on collaboration, could be seen as extending previous ‘Writing in the Disciplines’ research by focusing on a different discipline (design) and by applying a methodology that combines Systemic Functional Linguistics (SFL) and a corpus-based approach to data analysis. Specifically, we present a collaboration between a design professor and writing specialists aimed at scaffolding analytical argumentative writing in a design course. It is important to mention, however, that the writing assignments students had to complete in this course are examples of a pedagogical genre and do not necessarily reflect the type of writing design professionals do in the workplace. In other words, these assignments are distinct from workplace writing and are grounded in the rhetorical exigencies of the classroom. They do, however, require the application of analytical frameworks specific to the discipline of design and are aimed at helping students develop fluency in the discourse patterns (e.g., argumentation) that they will need to, for example, explain and defend their designs. 3 Approach to scaffolding student writing Our approach to scaffolding student writing through explicit instruction is grounded in a Systemic Functional Linguistics (SFL)-based approach to genre. SFL is a theory of language developed by Halliday (1985) that sees language as a resource for making meaning in a particular context of use rather than a set of fixed rules and structures (Martin, 2009; Martin & Rose, 2007). SFL considers that meaning and form are inseparable and aims to describe the meaning potential in language and the linguistic choices that are relevant in the construction of different types of genres. One of the main goals of writing instruction from an SFL-based orientation is that learners understand how language choices are influenced by a genre's social purpose. SFL-based genre instruction aims to make explicit the social purposes of texts, help students identify the features that characterize texts and that help to achieve their communicative purposes, and help students identify how texts are structured in terms of functional moves or stages. This is achieved by making language choices explicit to students and by scaffolding the production of increasingly complex genres. Awareness of the relationship between the goals of a genre and the linguistic resources that realize them can help student writers to develop both their writing ability and linguistic knowledge simultaneously. Previous studies in SFL-based genre pedagogy have shown the value of explicit instruction in enhancing student writing. However, most such studies have been carried out in primary and secondary school contexts (e.g., Brisk, 2014; Humphrey & Macnaught, 2016), with less research in higher education contexts. Particularly at the university level, explicit instruction of disciplinary writing often requires close collaboration between language specialists and disciplinary specialists (see, e.g., Stoller & Robinson, 2013, for a collaboration between applied linguistics and chemistry faculty). However, there is little research on the outcomes of using SFL-based genre pedagogy in interdisciplinary collaborations in terms of its effects on students’ writing. Since the focus of the design course in this study was on analytical argumentative writing, we briefly report on the literature on expectations and challenges of such writing. 4 Analytical argumentative writing: expectations and challenges Martin (1989) characterizes analytical argumentative texts as those that persuade the audience to adopt a certain intellectual position on a particular issue and argue for the credibility of a well-formulated claim or thesis. Learning to write analytical arguments is a crucial part of students’ induction into university-level work (Wu & Allison, 2005). However, for students who come into the university from backgrounds where such analytical writing, and its associated thinking, is not common, such writing poses several challenges. In fact, writing argumentatively is “one of the greatest challenges many English language learners (ELLs) are likely to face” (Hirvela, 2013, p. 67). This is in part because of the nature of the intrinsic demands posed by argumentative writing. It is also in part because university writers, particularly those writing in a second language, may still be in the process of “learning the valued genres of academic communication” (Tardy, 2009, p. 4). Thus, even when these students are expected to produce arguments, they do not always meet this expectation. This gap between instructors’ expectations and the writing that students produce may stem from varied and overlapping factors, including lack of academic preparation (Allison, 2009; Harklau, 1994, 2001; Hirvela, 2013), organization of ideas (Coffin & Hewings, 2004), balancing authoritative voice with inclusion of multiple perspectives (Coffin & Hewings, 2004; Pessoa, Miller, & Kaufer, 2014), and justifying claims with appropriate evidence (Silva, 1993). Given the importance of analytical argumentative writing in the undergraduate curriculum and students’ challenges meeting its expectations, scaffolding this type of writing is important. Previous work (Mitchell & Pessoa, in press) has shown the need to be explicit about when and how to write descriptively, and when and how to write analytically and argumentatively when writing in design. Our understanding of the differences between describing or reporting and writing analytically and argumentatively is based on Humphrey and Economou's (2015) ‘Onion model’, which is also informed by SFL and is used to refer to the relationship between four different discourse patterns of writing that are valued across academic disciplines (i.e., description, analysis, argumentation, and critique). In this model, description refers to the reproduction of agreed upon knowledge (from the discipline, the reading, or in general). This can be done by presenting information as entities (e.g., There are three levels of problems of communication according to Weaver: technical problems, semantic problems, and effectiveness problems) or as events in the form of a narrative that unfolds in time (e.g. Weaver's model of communication was developed in 1949 ). What differentiates analytical writing from descriptive writing is that, in analysis, the writer goes beyond presenting information as the way things are in the discipline. Analysis, then, involves the re-organization of information in some original way for the purposes of the text, such as applying a disciplinary framework to examples. A disciplinary framework may be thought of as a discipline's agreed-upon classificatory or analytical lenses, and often takes the form of a “received” taxonomy (i.e., given to students) that has multiple different elements. For example, in one of the assignments in the design course, students were asked to use a design heuristic, the useful/useable/desirable (UUD) framework, to critique design decisions on the university's campus. Specifically, students were asked to argue how useful, useable, and desirable a single object was for a specific purpose (i.e., learning, studying, social activities, physical and mental growth, etc.), how that object fit within the architectural space, how this space was part of the entire building and, finally, how the building was part of the campus as a whole. The UUD framework breaks down the factors that contribute to a positive user experience into different factors. When student writers engage in analysis, then, they are to break down a complex text or situation into smaller parts and show how the complex information fits into the elements of the taxonomy. The taxonomy from the disciplinary framework is then used to organize the text. This type of organization is what makes this text analytical rather than descriptive. The next layer in the Onion model is argumentation, 1 1 The Onion Model uses the label persuasion rather than argument. We opt to use the label argument as it most clearly aligns with the expectations of writing in the design course under study and in writing in the disciplines in general. which is a discourse pattern that has an explicit evaluation and typically unfolds with a claim supported by reasons. Argumentation uses both descriptive and analytical language, but does so in the service of an overarching explicit evaluation that is usually made at the beginning of a text. For example, in the first assignment from the design course, the students were to make an explicit evaluation about how good communication design can overcome noise (as defined by Weaver, 1949). To do this, the students first had to describe the concept of noise in their own words drawing on the course materials. The evaluation that the student made became the claim that was to be supported throughout the text using reasons. Thus, the text is typically organized by a claim-reasons framework. In assignment 1 from the design course, while the entire text should be structured by a claim-reasons framework, the reasons should be supported with analysis that incorporates description; the student needs to analyze examples (e.g., a particular poster) using design elements (e.g., typography) and blend description of the example with analysis of what has been described. Finally, critique 2 2 In our workshops, we did not focus on this discourse pattern because the specific type of writing that the design professor wanted students to work on did not involve challenging an aspect of disciplinary knowledge. refers to a discourse pattern where the writer challenges some aspect of disciplinary knowledge and positions the reader to accept this alternative position. Knowing which discourse pattern (i.e., description, analysis, argumentation) is necessary in an assignment can help students identify the language they will need to successfully accomplish the purpose of a text. It is important to note that these discourse patterns are not discrete and do not happen in isolation. That is, writing analytically requires a student to also describe (but in service of the analysis), and writing argumentatively also requires a degree of analysis (in service of the argument). A recurrent problem that we have seen across writing in the disciplines is that many students use description to demonstrate their comprehension of the material, and as a result rely predominantly on descriptive language while overlooking the need to analyze or support an evaluation (Mitchell, Miller, & Pessoa, 2016). It was our goal to help students move from merely reporting on the case to writing analytically and argumentatively. 3 3 Although the writing assignments in this course do not necessarily reflect the type of writing design professionals do, they helped students develop fluency in the discourse patterns (e.g., argumentation) that they will need to, for example, explain and defend their designs. 5 Corpus-driven analysis of student writing The study of academic writing development in a second language has greatly benefited in recent years by the development of corpora of learner writing, and the increased use of corpus tools in the study of writing development (e.g., Granger, Gilquin, & Meunier, 2013; Lee & Chen, 2009; Wulff & Gries, 2011). In this study, we make use of a corpus-based tool, DocuScope (Ishizaki & Kaufer, 2012a, 2012b), to investigate differences in the writing of students who participated in the writing workshops and those who did not. DocuScope is a dictionary-based text analysis software tool that automatically identifies, classifies, and stores word strings (Ishizaki & Kaufer, 2012a, 2012b). DocuScope is based on Kaufer and Butler's (1996, 2000) representational theory of composition, which asserts that the rhetorical effects that a reader perceives are the result of linguistic choices that an author makes to perform specific functions which create meaning in a text. In this sense, this theory comports with the basic tenets of SFL in that both view linguistic choices and their functional basis as part of a meaning-making system (Eggins, 2005). The DocuScope tool's dictionaries contain more than 45 million unique English patterns classified into categories of rhetorical experience. The DocuScope dictionaries were developed through extensive and iterative manual coding. Although the dictionaries were created manually, “creating dictionaries by hand is not necessarily a subjective task” (Taboada, Brooke, Tofiloski, Voll, & Stede, 2011, p. 297), and “a manually built dictionary provides a solid foundation for a lexion-based approach” (Taboada et al., 2011, p. 301). Though beyond the scope of this paper, the coding methods as well as an assessment of the internal and external validity of the codings, are described in detail in Kaufer, Ishizaki, Butler, and Collins (2004). Furthermore, Collins (2003) found that the categories in the DocuScope dictionaries discriminate patterns associated with the 15 genres contained in the Brown Corpus (Kucera & Francis, 1967) and the Freiburg-Brown Corpus (Hundt, Sand, & Skandera, 1999) in ways that comport with the intuitions of human classifiers. The DocuScope tool analyzes language into categories of rhetorical experience. For example, DocuScope tags the pronoun “I” as a “first person” effect, “if” as associated with a “contingency” effect, and “might happen” as an “uncertainty” effect. These are arranged into groups called dimensions, which are further grouped into clusters (there are a total of 21 clusters in the DocuScope system: Academic Language, Characters, Citation, Confidence, Contingency, Description, Facilitation, Forcefulness, First Person, Future, Information, Inquiry, Interactivity, Metadiscourse, Narrative, Negativity, Positivity, Public Communication, Reasoning, Strategy, and Uncertainty). DocuScope scans a corpus of texts and counts the number of patterns found for each rhetorical effect. An advantage of DocuScope is that its coding system contains both single words and longer strings (up to 17 words in length); for example, while “I” is coded as “first person”, the phrase “in this paper, I will” is coded as metadiscourse indicating the structure of an essay. 4 4 It should be noted that while the DocuScope dictionaries are extensive, they are not exhaustive, and, thus, there may be instances that may not be caught by the DocuScope dictionaries. This is a limitation of any dictionary-based (lexicon-based) corpus analysis. In previous research, DocuScope has been used to analyze the longitudinal development of multilingual students’ academic writing (Miller & Pessoa, 2017; Pessoa et al., 2014), pragmatic functions in academic writing (Zhao & Kaufer, 2013), and features of higher- and lower graded placement essays (Ishizaki & Wetzel, 2008). Although DocuScope has often been used for genre analysis, it should be distinguished from tools whose goal is to classify texts into genres (e.g. Argamon, Whitelaw, Chase, & Hota, 2007; Stein & Eissen, 2008). DocuScope is designed to deepen the understanding of how genre is enacted on the textual surface through language choices (Ishizaki & Kaufer, 2012a, 2012b). Similar to other tools, such as Biber's (1985) multidimensional analysis, DocuScope identifies genre features based on multidimensional analysis of covariation among variables. However, different from other systems, which capture functional distinctions through analysis of grammatical categories, the DocuScope system directly targets functional categories (i.e., the experience that is created in the reader when a phrase is used) (Klebanov, Kaufer, Yeoh, Ishizaki, & Holtzman, 2016). Similar to Hoey (2005) concept of lexical priming, Kaufer argues that “words in use prime an audience's experience and different words prime different experiences” (Kaufer et al., 2004, p. xvii). Take, for example, the word smear: whereas the expression to smear a politician contributes to a negative expression, smearing soap contributes to an expression of everyday motion, rather than negativity (Ishizaki & Kaufer, 2012a, 2012b, 277). Although there have been some previous corpus-driven SFL studies, these have been limited in number and many have relied on manual annotation of a very small corpus or a small sample from a larger corpus (O’Donnell, 2014). Use of corpora in SFL research has been limited largely due to the difficulty of automating analysis of the kinds of meaning-based, contextualized uses of language that SFL researchers are interested in (O’Donnell, 2014). Thus, much corpus-based SFL research to date has used corpus tools to investigate specific lexical items (e.g., Flowerdew, 2003) or specific grammatical structures (e.g., McDonald & Woodward-Kron, 2016), which are then interpreted in SFL terms. The tool used in the present study, DocuScope, uses meaning, rather than frequency of specific lexical items or grammatical structures, as its starting point, allowing for a more meaning-based, contextualized understanding of students’ writing. In what follows, we first describe the context of the study and our process of collaboration to scaffold student writing. Then, we report on the outcomes of the collaboration based on a corpus-based analysis of student writing and we compare it to the writing of students who took the class in a previous semester, where the workshops were not offered. 6 Methods 6.1 Context Our data are drawn from a larger investigation of academic literacy development at a branch campus of an American university in the Middle East, where most of the students have English as an additional language. All courses at this institution are taught in English, and the curriculum largely follows that of the main campus in the U.S. In the present study, we focus on writing in a course titled “The Designed World: A Liberal Inquiry into Design and Human Experience,” taken by second- through fourth-year students not majoring in design. The design professor described the course as a reading-intensive and discussion-driven course that introduces students to design history, theory, and criticism. The course comprises four units: communication (visual design), construction (industrial design), interaction (design for experience), and integration (using design principles from the first three units to address complex systems/problems). For each unit, students are required to write an analytical argument paper in which they apply one or more theoretical frameworks from the course to evaluate the design of real-world objects, spaces, experiences, or systems. These papers range from 1000 to 2400 words. The first paper assignment asks students to write an argument for how noise can be overcome through good communication design. Students are instructed to first explain in their own words Warren Weaver's (1949) concept of noise, and to apply this disciplinary framework to two or more examples of communication design (e.g., wayfinding systems, documents, posters, data visualizations, infographics). Students are explicitly encouraged to not lose the focus of their argument in their illustration of the examples. The analysis of the chosen examples has to support the argument that noise can be overcome through good communication design. The second written assignment asks students to use a design heuristic, the useful/useable/desirable framework, to evaluate design decisions of the campus. Students are asked to argue how useful, useable, desirable a single object is for a specific purpose (i.e., learning, studying, social activities, physical and mental growth, etc.), how that object fits within the architectural space interacted, how this space is part of the entire building and, finally, how the building is part of the campus as a whole. The final paper 5 5 Although there were four assignments (and we scaffolded the writing of all four), the third assignment was largely descriptive in nature, rather than analytical and argumentative, so we are not including it in our analysis. assignment asks students to explicate the concept of wicked problems (Rittel & Webber, 1973) through an example of their choosing (e.g., pollution), and then to argue for the value of a human-centered design approach to address a wicked problem. This assignment asks students to consider counterarguments and to draw on multiple theoretical frameworks from the semester to show how such a perspective can help address the problem. Several of the course objectives stated in the syllabus are directly related to these papers: (1) to study and apply a set of design frameworks to approach ideas, design products, and systems; (2) to develop and strengthen skills in analysis and critical thinking of and about the built world; (3) to develop and strengthen skills in academic reading and interpretation; (4) to develop and strengthen skills in argument and scholarly writing; and (5) to communicate interpretations and evaluations in verbal discourse. Our data set contains papers written by two groups of students who completed these assignments, those who received the redesigned assignments and writing workshops, and those in a previous semester before the assignments were redesigned and before the workshops were implemented. As mentioned earlier, the design professor was interested in improving student outcomes because he was adamant about the importance of strong written communication skills for designers, and he felt that our expertise in supporting disciplinary writing would be valuable for his students. Thus, the collaboration with the design professor was a key component of the study. Next, we describe the process of collaboration with the design professor. 6.2 The process of collaboration The collaboration with the design professor involved helping him revise his writing assignments and conducting in-class writing workshops prior to each of the four assignments. A detailed explanation of the collaboration with this professor is beyond the scope of this article (for more information, see Mitchell & Pessoa, in press). In brief, our collaboration can be described as a three-part process. First, we tried to understand what the professor valued in student writing through the analysis of papers written by his former students, followed by think-aloud protocols by the professor with these same papers, and interviews with him to unpack his expectations for writing that were not explicit in his assignment descriptions. The second part involved collaborative rewriting of the assignment descriptions and developing materials for the workshops. After the iterative process of redesigning course materials, we designed workshop materials to scaffold the writing of each of the assignments. In these workshops, we co-taught with the professor to explain the assignment guidelines for each paper and guided the students through brainstorming activities to generate strategies for executing the assignment's structure, functional moves, and connections to course material. We delivered a total of 4 writing workshops; each workshop lasted 80 minutes. The writing workshops occurred in his class approximately two weeks before each assignment was due. There were approximately 20 students in the class. In the workshop to scaffold the writing of the first assignment, where students were to make an explicit evaluation about how good communication design can overcome noise (as defined by Weaver, 1949), we explained that students had to first make an explicit evaluation (e.g., Noise is reduced in this sign through the effective use of symbols and visual hierarchy). This evaluation became the claim the student writer had to defend and support throughout the analysis. In making an evaluation, we stated that tempered, nuanced, and balanced evaluations (e.g., the sign is effective in reducing noise to some extent) are usually valued across the disciplines because they show complexity of thought and critical thinking. We explained that the text should adopt a claim-reasons framework to create a structure for their text. Students were to use the received taxonomy of design concepts learned in the class (e.g., symbols, visual hierarchy, typography, colors) and focus on two specific elements of the taxonomy (i.e., symbols and visual hierarchy) to analyze a sign, poster, etc. of their choice. These elements became the reasons for how noise was reduced in the sign under study. When analyzing the sign, we emphasized that it was necessary to break down the sign into its components, to describe and interpret the components, and to show how they are examples of effective use of symbols and visual hierarchy. In other words, students needed to analyze a sign (e.g., a particular poster) using design elements (e.g., typography) and blend description of the example with analysis of what they had described. The key point here is that description had to be used in the service of the analysis and both description and analysis had to be used in the service of the main argument of the text. We also emphasized that to write a satisfactory text, students also had to rely on the readings from the course to define and explain the elements of the taxonomy. Another feature of analysis and argument we made reference to in the workshop is the acknowledgment of alternative perspectives. Effective analysis and argument imagines a reader who may not agree with the analysis or evaluation of the writer and counters the alternative perspective with more evidence with the use of phrases such as even, might, seem, although this…that, while this…that. The final part of the collaboration focused on evaluating the outcomes of the collaboration using multiple types of data, including a follow-up interview with the professor to reflect upon the collaboration and its outcomes, and analysis of a corpus of student writing. 6.3 The corpus and analysis Our corpus-based analysis included student writing from two iterations of the course that did not have the workshops (a total of 230 texts; 190,896 words) and two iterations of the course that did have the workshops (a total of 158 texts; 269,630 words). 6 6 The reason why there are more texts from students who did not participate in the workshops is that there were more students enrolled in the earlier iterations of the course, which didn’t include workshops, than the later iterations, which did include workshops. As described earlier, we used the corpus-based tool DocuScope in our analysis. This tool was chosen because it is based on a theory of composition that comports with approaches to writing instruction that are grounded in SFL in that both view the learning of new genres as the learning of language choices to achieve a genre's communicative purposes. Because we were interested in the ways that student writing with the workshops differed from student writing without the workshops, we compared the frequency of occurrence of each DocuScope rhetorical effect cluster in the two sub-corpora. We corrected for multiple comparisons using the Benjamini-Hochberg correction set with a false discovery rate of .05, and we report Benjamini-Hochberg FDR-adjusted p-values. Because the quantitative analysis only shows whether the frequency of each rhetorical function in each sub-corpus differed or not and to what degree, we also conducted subsequent qualitative analyses to better understand how the rhetorical functions were used in the students’ texts. This qualitative analysis also allowed us to identify ‘false-positives’ or miscategorizations. For example, we found that the word design was often miscategorized. Most often, it was categorized in the Strategy cluster, which, according to the designers of the software, includes language related to “advantage-seeking, game-playing cognition, plans, and goal-seeking,” or as a conscious cognitive state, which, according to the designers of the software, indicates being “cognitively deliberate and conscious,’ such as in the phrase by design. However, in nearly all cases in the texts in this study, design was used in reference to the field of design or to describe the design features of something (drawing on disciplinary knowledge), rather than as a type of strategic action or an indication specifically of conscious action. Thus, we excluded the word design from the analysis. Another example is the words wicked and problem. DocuScope classified both of these in the Negativity cluster, but, as described earlier, one of the assignments asked students describe a wicked problem. Thus, we excluded the term wicked problem because it was used in reference to a discipline-specific concept rather than the author's choice to indicate negativity. 7 Results 7.1 Corpus analysis Our corpus-based analysis revealed that some rhetorical functions occurred significantly more frequently in the writing of students who participated in the writing workshops (higher-occurrence rhetorical functions) while others occurred significantly less frequently (lower-occurrence rhetorical functions). Below, we describe each of these rhetorical functions, with illustrations of usage from students’ writing. 7 7 Many of the excerpts were chosen because they include multiple examples of how a certain feature appeared in student texts, allowing us to more efficiently illustrate multiple usages in a shorter text segment. As a result, many of the excerpts shown contain a higher proportion of a certain feature than was typical in the student writing. Nonetheless, the differences between the texts from the group who participated in workshops and those who did not were statistically significant. 7.1.1 Higher-occurrence rhetorical functions There were four rhetorical functions which occurred more frequently in the writing of the students who participated in the workshops: Academic Language, Negativity, Reasoning, and Citation (see Table 1 ). The Academic Language cluster includes abstract and specialized words that are common in academic writing. Within the Academic Language cluster, the writing from the class with workshops was particularly higher in the Specialized Terms dimension, which includes the use of specialized, discipline-specific words. Looking more closely at how students used such terms, we found that these terms were used particularly for the purpose of analysis when introducing and applying a disciplinary framework, as in (1), (2) and (3). (1) Figure 1 shows the pedestrian sign for the city of Westminster in England. Noise is reduced in this sign through the effective use of symbols and visual hierarchy. Symbols are integral in the creation of universal wayfinding systems, especially when they are well designed and used in the appropriate context. (Khalid, Assignment 1, Noise) (2) In Figure 1, the sign is also not ordered according to the visual hierarchy system, and this will cause the interruption in understanding the message or in other words noise. As mentioned previously, the way to reduce or eliminate noise is to maintain good communication design; therefore, in this case, maintaining a good communication design means that there needs to be a way of communicating other than text and this can be best done using iconography and visual hierarchy. (Noora, Assignment 1, Noise) (3) Common spaces such as the [university] campus are designed for people. A common framework that allows us to assess the effectiveness of the [university] campus in delivering academic activities for people is the UUD framework. Designed spaces and their constituent parts should be Usable, Useful, and Desirable. Using this framework, we are able to assess the effectiveness of the [university] campus on a small scale within [this building], branch out to the medium scale where we are looking at classrooms and common spaces, reaching a university-wide scale, and finally the [university]-wide scale. (Issa, Assignment 2, UUD framework) In (1), the student uses the received taxonomy of design concepts learned in the class (e.g., symbols, visual hierarchy, typography, colors) and focuses on two specific elements of the taxonomy (i.e., symbols and visual hierarchy) to analyze a pedestrian sign. These elements become the reasons for how noise is being reduced in the sign under study. In (2), the student also introduces a received disciplinary framework about communication design, including two distinct elements, location and visual hierarchy. In (3), the student explicitly introduces a design heuristic, the useful/useable/desirable (UUD) framework to argue how useful, useable, and desirable a single object on campus was for a specific purpose (i.e., learning, studying, social activities, physical and mental growth, etc.), how that object fit within the architectural space, how this space was part of the entire building and, finally, how the building was part of the campus as a whole. The Negativity rhetorical effect cluster was mostly used in the last assignment of the course, which asked students to identify a wicked problem, or a problem that is complex, ill-defined, and strongly impacts society. In this assignment, students were to explain the concept of wicked problems (Rittel & Webber, 1973) through an example of their choosing (e.g., pollution), and then to argue for the value of a human-centered design approach to address the wicked problem. The students in the class that had the workshops more clearly explained why their chosen wicked problem could be defined as a wicked problem through descriptions of negative effects caused by the problem (see (4) and (5) below). On the other hand, the students who did not receive the workshops focused more on descriptions of phenomena (see (6) below). (4) Electronic waste is a wicked problem that has a long-term impact on the earth. The environmental, societal and economic impact of e-waste is astonishing. Electronic waste contains toxic material such as zinc, lead, barium and chromium. Most of the wasted electronics are disposed of in landfills located in third world countries. This results in groundwater pollution and in the release of toxic chemicals into the air. Overall, the integrity of the earth's resources is threatened. Also, the socioeconomic impact of electronic waste on those living near the electronic waste landfill is fatal. The workers’ exposure to the e-waste puts them at risk of suffering from blood diseases, tuberculosis, lung cancer and malfunctioning of the kidney and respiratory system (Lundgren, 2012, p. 20). (Reem, Assignment 4, Wicked Problems) (5) Air pollution can be considered as a wicked problem because air pollution is one of the biggest issues that causes global warming and water pollution. The causes of air pollution are gases coming from cars, trucks, factories, burning garbage, and agricultural activities. Actually, the polluted air resulted in rise up to the clouds which leads to falling of acidic rains which damage the crops and pollute water which destroys the aquarium life. (Yara, Assignment 4, Wicked Problems) In (4), the student explains why the chosen wicked problem (i.e., electronic waste) can be considered wicked by describing the negative effects of the problem on the environment, society and economy. Similarly, in (5), the student explains why the chosen wicked problem (i.e., air pollution) can be defined as ‘wicked’ by referring to its negative impact (i.e., global warming and water pollution). On the contrary, in (6) below, written by a student who did not participate in the writing workshops, the student chooses poverty as an example of a wicked problem, but fails to address why poverty is a wicked problem and to describe its negative effects. Although the student makes reference to the effects of poverty on education and nutrition, they are not presented in the context of explaining why poverty can be referred to as a ‘wicked’ problem. (6) Let's take poverty as an example of a wicked problem, which design or no other system has been able to solve. The reason design didn’t come up with a solution is because the problem itself is so complex. The amount of communication that it requires is so complex that design hasn’t been able to figure out a proper solution for it. It's because poverty is connected with education and nutrition in one way or the other, and the economy depends on nutrition as well. These problems are typically offloaded to policy makers or are written off as being too cumbersome to handle by small and individual organizations. (Alana, Assignment 4, Wicked Problems) Another rhetorical function that occurred significantly more frequently in the writing of the students who participated in the writing workshops is Reasoning. The Reasoning cluster includes language indicating forward reasoning (e.g., thus, therefore), backward reasoning (e.g., because, owing to the fact) and oppositional reasoning (e.g., it is not the case that) and is indicative of logical reasoning in constructing an argument (Pessoa et al., 2014). (7) and (8) below were written by students who participated in the writing workshops. (7) This design makes effective use of visual hierarchy because the sign gets more and more specific based on the spectator's needs. It starts with the least specific information and develops more information depth as the user goes down the sign. By making good use of visual hierarchy, the sign avoids an overload of information and manages to communicate the message concisely. The supplemental information is a way to reduce any noise represented in the top part of the sign, therefore eliminating the semantic issues that could possibly be associated with the sign. While the sign is quite big in size and could have had more information, its quite minimalistic design presented with effective visual hierarchy reduces noise (Ifaz, Assignment 1, Noise) (8) The library chairs are useful because they serve their purpose. In other words, in terms of the usability component of the UUD framework, it can be stated that the library chairs are usable because they give the user the ability to move from a place to another and rotate to communicate with different people easily. This comes in handy when students have to do group work and interact with the different members of the group” (Raabia, Assignment 2, UUD framework) In (7), the student structures the text using a claim-reasons framework. The student uses the received taxonomy of design concepts learned in the class (e.g., symbols, visual hierarchy, typography, colors) and focuses on a specific element of the taxonomy (i.e., visual hierarchy) to analyze a pedestrian sign. The analysis of this element becomes the reason for how noise is being reduced in the pedestrian sign. The main element of the claim-reason taxonomy is stated as an abstract noun (i.e., visual hierarchy) and is linked by logical relations using because, is a way to, therefore, while, as in, This design makes effective use of visual hierarchy because the sign gets more and more specific based on the spectator's needs. In (8), the student also structures the text using a claim-reasons framework and states why the chairs at the campus’ library fit within the architectural space. Specifically, the student relies on a received taxonomy of design concepts (i.e., the useful/useable/desirable (UUD) framework) to organize the reasons-claim framework. As in (7) above, the main element of the claim-reason taxonomy is stated as an abstract noun (i.e., usability component of the UUD framework) and is linked by logical relations using because, as in, The library chairs are usable because they give the user the ability to move from a place to another and rotate to communicate with different people easily. In contrast, in (9), written by a student who did not participate in the workshops, the student introduces a received taxonomy (“Ideas, Systems, Cultures, Environment, and Values”), but in the subsequent sentences, he does not use logical relations to link his examples to the taxonomy. (9) A company that is producing pork meat should consider Ideas, Systems, Cultures, Environment, and Values of the Qatari people. The product doesn’t fit in with the culture of Qatar as this is forbidden in Islam to eat or sell this type of product. We can see that the producers lacked this aspect of culture before implementing their products. The quote of Papanek explains that integration has to do with decision-making. So for every business, they must look at the aspect of integration before implementing their product. (Patrick, Assignment 4, Wicked Problems) Finally, Citation is also a rhetorical function that occurred significantly more frequently in the writing of the students who participated in the writing workshops. The Citation cluster is active when the writer makes reference to others through citation of their words. This cluster also includes the use of words indicating external sources (e.g., according to, to cite, to quote from the words of, some have argued that), by which the writer characterizes other writers and their ideas. The DocuScope analysis showed that students who participated in the writing workshops referred more to outside sources, as in (10) and (11) below. (10) Education City is intended to be an integrated campus; however, its design does not transcend this intent. All the components of an integrated campus should serve a certain purpose in elements such as but not limited to design, location, spacing, form, and function. The architecture should be a tool that facilitates academic activities in an educational campus. Goldberger (2009) illustrates this notion through the Vitrivius’ view of the conflicting realities of architecture. He emphasizes the need to shift our view of architecture from a paradox of conflicting realities to a system of co-existing elements that serve a specific purpose such as academic activities. All the buildings within an integrated campus “must simultaneously be useful, well-built and visually appealing” (Goldberger, 2009). The universities, colleges, and facilities within EC may be usable on an individual scale, however, they are not usable when looked at holistically. This is mainly attributed to the large spacing that exists between the universities, and the larger distance that exists between these universities and the facilities available around EC. (Laaibah, Assignment 2, UUD framework) (11) The pedestrian sign for the city of Westminster effectively uses symbols to convey information. Symbols are integral in the creation of universal wayfinding systems, especially when they are well designed and used in the appropriate context. Paul Rand (1985) states that the symbol is “the common language between artist and spectator” (p.7). A symbol is not necessarily a reproduction, but rather a representation of what is invisible to the spectator. In the case of the pedestrian sign for the city of Westminster, the location of three places (i.e., Bond Street, Oxford Circus, and Grosvenor Berkeley) is signaled […] (Khalid, Assignment 1, Noise) In (10), the student integrates external voices into her text to develop an argumentative stance. The writer opens up the dialog to external voices using phrases such as Goldberger (2009) illustrates this notion and He emphasizes and by then citing the author's exact words (i.e., All the buildings within an integrated campus “must simultaneously be useful, well-built and visually appealing” (Goldberger, 2009)). The student writer then closes the dialog by moving the reader toward her interpretation of the design of the universities, colleges, and facilities within EC. Similarly, in (11), the student writer also brings in the voices from the course readings (e.g., Paul Rand) to define and explain an element of the received taxonomy (i.e., symbols). Specifically, the writer cites course material to frame the analysis. By referring to material from the course reading, the student writer shows that his analysis is sound and authoritative because it relies on authorities in the discipline and it is not happening in isolation from what has been discussed in the discipline. On the contrary, in (12) below, written by a student who did not participate in the writing workshops, the writer succeeds in citing course material, but the cited material does not help the writer to develop an argumentative stance. The writer drops the quotation and fails to connect it to the rest of the text. (12) According to Warren Weaver in ‘The Mathematics of Communication’, “Noise is the unwanted additions that may be distortions of sound (in telephony, for example), or static (in radio), or distortions in the shape or shading of a picture (television), or errors in transmission (telegraphy or facsimile).” Information is a measure of one's freedom of choice in selecting a message in any medium. Therefore, greater the freedom of choice, the greater is the uncertainty that the message will be interpreted in the way wanted by the sender. (Alana, Assignment 1, Noise) 7.1.2 Lower-occurrence rhetorical functions There were four rhetorical functions that occurred significantly less frequently in the writing of students who participated in the writing workshops: Forcefulness, First Person, Characters, and Narrative (see Table 2 ). The Forcefulness rhetorical effect cluster is active when the writer uses language that is emphatic, intense, insistent, or deals in absolutes or extremes. Looking more closely at the students’ writing, we see that the students who did not receive the workshops more often used this type of language in their descriptions and evaluations, as seen in (13) and (14) below, rather than making their evaluations tempered, nuanced, and balanced. (13) In my opinion, Design appears everywhere, in each and every aspect of life. For instance, in shopping for clothes and accessories, design along with other factors plays a very crucial role in attracting buyers. (Victoria, Assignment 1, Noise) (14) Given the new brand that is was in the region, they had gone all the way with amazing offers and free goodies at the store. (Abeed, Assignment 2, UUD framework) In (13) and (14), the students give descriptions that use language that is quite strong and absolute; that is, language that ‘turns up the volume’ (e.g., everywhere, each and every, very crucial, gone all the way, amazing offers). The use of such language makes it more difficult for an argument to show complexity of thought or nuance. 8 8 We do acknowledge, however, that there may be instances where forceful language is appropriate, and that hedging merely for the sake of hedging (i.e., rather than as an appeal to an audience) may also be ineffective. On the other hand, the writing of students who received the workshops more often included language that tempered the descriptions and evaluations, as seen in (15) and (16) (e.g., can help, some sort of idea, I believe, somewhat, more, less). (15) An example of how icons created with ambiguity can help to reduce noise is when you look at the Game Center icons. If you see the Game Center icon in iOS 6 you still get some sort of an idea that the application is related to games since it has symbols of chess, baseball, darts and a rocket ship; however, when you look at the icon for it in iOS 7, you don’t get any idea of what the application is about from the icon. The iOS 7 icon for game center I believe is increasing the noise by causing confusion to the user as the icon and the label don’t appear to relate to each other. (Aga, Assignment 1, Noise) (16) The furniture, rooms, hallways inside a building, as well as its outer environment, should be designed to serve different purposes required by humans. One of the environments in Qatar that are designed to satisfy several purposes is the Education City campus. It can somewhat satisfy the purposes of learning, studying, creating a collaborative and productive environment. In this paper I will focus on the purpose of productivity, and how [university] campus is somewhat effective in encouraging this purpose through multiple scales; encouraging it more in smaller scales such as selection of furniture, and arrangement of studying spaces, while it is less encouraged on larger scales, such as the relationships between the buildings. (Huda, Assignment 2, UUD framework) The DocuScope analysis also showed that the First Person, Character and Narrative clusters were higher in the writing of the students from the class with no workshops. These clusters will be discussed together since they are closely related. The First Person cluster is active when writers include themselves in their writing or rely on a first person narrator and the use of words indicating self-reference and individualized thoughts and feelings (e.g., I, me, my, myself in (17) and (18) below). The Character rhetorical function includes language for naming and describing individuals or entities and is typical of narrative writing and recounting of experiences (Kaufer & Butler, 2000) (e.g., my family, my niece, our side of the family in (19) below). The Narrative cluster is active when the writer tells stories about what has happened. Such stories typically involve narrative verbs, indicating punctuated action in the past, structuring plot and action. This dimension is also active when the writer describes units of time as framing for a narrative (e.g., Every night, just about the time my family leaves the dinner table in (19) below). (17) I drive my car every day, so I find its parts are very important for me. Therefore, I wanted to take this opportunity to focus on something that most of us don’t give a big attention to. However, without it we can’t drive our cars safely. The first thing I do when I sit in the car seat and start driving is cleaning my windshield from dust. Windshield wipers are used to clean the windshield of a car, so that the driver has an unobstructed view of the road. (Meena, Assignment 2, UUD framework) (18) I think such guitars are extremely useful to beginners like me because the built-in tuner comes with a tiny screen that shows me what notes/chords are being played and helps greatly in self-learning. This is exactly how I learnt to play the guitar, without any formal training. In “The Design of Everyday Things”, Norman notes that two of the most important characteristics of good design are discoverability and understanding. I believe that the guitar is a good example of discoverability and understanding for me as its functions (such as the amplification or the built-in tuner) are relatively easy to understand and play around with. For instance, even a beginner level guitarist like me can easily tune his/her guitar in the process of discovering to use the tuner. (Valerie, Assignment 2, UUD framework) (19) Every night, just about the time my family leaves the dinner table, my niece comes running to me. Carrying her white iPad 2, she holds my hand and drags me to her room, asking me with the most angelic face to read her a bedtime story. With the fake sound of turning pages, I go about reading her a story or two. I smile at the thought that my niece inherited the love of reading from our side of the family. Shockingly enough, a recent statistic shows that the average time that the Arabic child from the age of 6-10 spent on reading is six minutes! That's six minutes outside the school curriculum. (Maria, Assignment 4, Wicked Problems) In (17), (18), and (19), the student writers position themselves as first person narrators and rely on narratives and descriptions of personal experiences (e.g., The first thing I do when I sit in the car seat and start driving is cleaning my windshield from dust; I think such guitars are extremely useful to beginners like me because the built-in tuner comes with a tiny screen that shows me what notes/chords are being played and helps greatly in self-learning; Carrying her white iPad 2, she holds my hand and drags me to her room, asking me with the most angelic face to read her a bedtime story) to initiate their analysis of the importance and usefulness of specific objects using the UUD framework (in the case of (17) and (18)) or the importance of design for addressing a Wicked Problem (in the case of (19)). Although the description of events in the form of a narrative that unfolds in time is an important discourse pattern, students did not succeed in using it strategically to achieve the more complex functions of analysis and persuasion. In other words, students who did not participate in the writing workshops relied too much on description and did not succeed in using it strategically in the service of the argument. On the contrary, the lower occurrence of these rhetorical functions in the writing of students who participated in the writing workshops suggests that the students succeeded in presenting information in a factual, objective manner without extensive description and narration. On the other hand, the students who received the workshops used language in the First Person, Character and Narrative clusters much less, and when they did use them, the students used them in service of their analysis and argument. For example, in (20) below, we see instances of the First Person (I’m, I), Character (females, males), and Narrative (most of the time) clusters. (20) Most of the time when I’m looking for a prayer room I have to figure out in some way which is for females and which is for males. There is a problem with these signs’ human figures as they should be more informative than confusing. The problem is with the communication design of the sign. Communication design is how the information or data is designed in a way to communicate with people. And a good communication design is when the information and data is delivered to the targeted audience correctly. The cause of the confusion or misunderstanding in the communication according to Weaver (1949) is called noise. (Babur, Assignment 1, Noise) However, in (20), we see that the first-person narrative of a personal experience in the first sentence is used to introduce a disciplinary concept, communication design. The student then defines this term, and relates it to the disciplinary framework that will be used in the rest of the paper, noise. In this way, the initial first-person narrative is not simply a narrative, but it is a narrative that is used in service of subsequent analysis and argument. 7.2 Follow-up interview with the design professor After our collaboration with the design professor, we interviewed him about his insights on the re-designing of the assignments, the workshops, and student writing. He was very positive about the collaboration and its outcomes. He reflected on how the detailed nature of the assignment guidelines made a difference in helping students better understand his expectations and how to meet them, in contrast to his first original short assignment guidelines: I guess I realized that sometimes an assignment prompt itself can be like a page long. I’ve always been under the assumption that a nice short, snappy, concise assignment prompt is good because it's clear, it's short and it will allow them [the students] leeway to go wherever they want with it. But, actually, that's not necessarily the best approach. I think I probably inherit that approach from pretty much every written assignment prompt I’ve ever gotten. All I ever got as a student was like, one or two sentences, write blah-blah-blah, include this and that. Having a nice expanded-upon longer assignment prompt that allows you to communicate the faculty expectations will allow you to really encourage them to structure it in a specific way. The post-collaboration interview showed his appreciation for the more detailed guidelines: The papers are demonstrating more – like they’re showing that they are making more connections between the authors, the in-class material. They’re thinking about that material in critical ways and with the new prompts that we’re giving them, it's so much more structured. Thus, from the interview with the design professor, we can see that he found the collaboration to be productive, and that it resulted in clearer and more explicit communication of expectations to students, and, as a result, better analytical argumentative writing. 8 Discussion In this paper we presented model of collaboration between English faculty and disciplinary faculty that can be useful in meeting the needs of the increasing number of linguistically and culturally diverse students in higher education. In international branch campuses of English-medium universities, increasing numbers of multilingual students have to meet the writing demands and expectations of disciplinary teachers who may not have any training in pedagogy, let alone L2 writing pedagogy. Thus, we argue that collaborations like the one presented in this paper are needed to help disciplinary teachers scaffold L2 writing development. Such a model of collaboration can have a positive impact on teacher development and student writing outcomes, as we observed in this study and as reported in the literature on interdisciplinary collaborations between language experts and teachers in the disciplines at the primary and secondary school levels (see, e.g., Brisk, 2014; Humphrey & Macnaught, 2016; Humphrey, Sharpe, & Cullen, 2015) and to a lesser extent in higher education (see, however, Dreyfus, Humphrey, Mahboob, & Martin, 2016; Pessoa, Mitchell, & Miller, 2018; Pessoa, Mitchell, & Reilly, in press). The study of academic writing development in a second language has greatly benefited in recent years from the development of corpora of learner writing, and the increased use of corpus tools in the study of writing development (e.g. Granger et al., 2013; Lee & Chen, 2009; Wulff & Gries, 2011). Although limited in number (O’Donnell, 2014), the amount of SFL research using corpus methods has been increasing (e.g., Bednarek, 2010; Hunston, 2013). However, much previous SFL research that has used corpus methods has focused on specific lexical items or specific grammatical structures, rather than having contextualized meaning as its starting point. In addition, there has been little previous corpus-based research investigating the effects of SFL-based instruction. In this study, we made use of the corpus-based tool DocuScope (Ishizaki & Kaufer, 2012a, 2012b) to investigate the effects of a disciplinary writing intervention based on SFL-based genre pedagogy. Although the DocuScope tool does not directly make use of SFL categories of analysis, its use of meaning-based categories of rhetorical functions allowed us to identify changes in students’ writing that could be traced to specific aspects of the SFL-based instruction implemented. In this way, the DocuScope tool helped us to confirm not that students were using specific lexis or grammar, but that they were using language to construct valued meanings in their texts. Our corpus-driven analysis of student writing showed that: (1) there were four higher-occurrence rhetorical functions in the writing of the students who participated in the workshops: Academic Language, Negativity, Reasoning, and Citation, and (2) there were four rhetorical functions that occurred significantly less frequently in the writing of students who participated in the writing workshops: Forcefulness, First Person, Characters, and Narrative. These differences point to improvement in student writing compared to the semester where no writing workshops were offered, particularly in the use of linguistic resources to write analytically. Students who participated in the workshops more consistently used specialized, discipline-specific words to frame their analysis using design theory; effectively introduced and integrated the course authors to set up the argument; and highlighted both positive and negative features of communication design. Thus, our study provides further support for the importance of discipline-specific literacy interventions (De La Paz, 2005; Monte-Sano, 2010) emphasizing the role of explicit focus on language, as exemplified by SFL-based genre pedagogy, to scaffold student writing development (Coffin, 2006; Humphrey & Macnaught, 2016). 9 Pedagogical implications The present study has a number of pedagogical implications. First, our findings highlight the importance of explicit writing instruction. We argue for the effectiveness of the Onion Model (Humphrey & Economou, 2015) for scaffolding analytical argumentative writing to unpack the language features of description, analysis, and argument needed to effectively write analytical argumentative texts. Writing instructors can use model texts and deconstruct them with students by using guiding questions to call the students’ attention to the main purpose of an assignment, its specific stages, whether they will mainly need description, analysis, or argument to effectively complete the assignment, and what the language of each looks like. Although some researchers have argued that using model texts represents genres too narrowly and inhibits students’ creativity as writers (e.g., Elbow, 1999; Smagorinski, 1998), model texts allow student writers, particularly those writing in a second language, to notice specific uses of language that reflect the text's purposes. We suggest, however, that instructors go beyond simply supplying model texts by helping students develop explicit knowledge of rhetorical features by making these features explicit for students. We also suggest that assignment descriptions and rubrics take into account rhetorical functions and the language through which they are realized. For example, it is helpful to have explicit instructions stating that there should be little elaboration or extended description, and instructions could include examples of language that enacts the discourse patterns needed for the assignment. Assessment rubrics should also reflect linguistic choices as they construe rhetorical functions.

Box 1 Examples of projects using CI by each reason Reasons for using CI Example Create intellectual outputs - DREAM challenge is an open science initiative. It leverages CI to use data from clinical trials to create predictive models (e.g., prognostic model of survival rate, prediction model of treatment response) [19,20] - A project used crowdsourcing to mobilize 60 physicians/researchers and 42 patients/advocates to develop a protocol for a cancer trial [21]. This pilot project led to the creation of an online community of doctors and patients to develop protocols of clinical trials called Transparency life sciences [22] Generate ideas - Harvard Medical School launched idea challenges to leverage CI from the community to generate new research ideas on type I diabetes [17] - Researchers used a creative contributory contest to ask community members to contribute new ideas for an HIV testing campaign [23] Conduct evaluation - CrowdCARE is an initiative that mobilizes the knowledge and skills of the crowd to critically evaluate the evidence from health practice to facilitate evidence synthesis [24] Solve problems - DYSCERNE used crowdsourcing to create a network of clinicians in 26 different European countries for the clinical diagnosis of very rare genetic syndromes of multiple congenital anomalies [18] - Foldit and Phylo are online games that allow users to manipulate the structures of proteins to solve problems of the order and structure of nucleotides in proteins to help cure diseases [25,26] Box 2 Main features of types of participants' contributions Methods of participants' contribution Examples Main features Independent contribution (collection) - Transparency life science is a platform that mobilizes clinicians and patients in clinical trial protocol development. A clinical trial protocol is divided into several items (i.e., inclusion, exclusion criteria, intervention, sample size). Clinicians, patients, and relatives independently review and contribute to improve the items. Their contribution is aggregated to create a complete protocol that is reviewed again by community members for final approval [21] - Work is divided into small pieces; participants can work independently - There is a mechanism for aggregating contributions from all participants (e.g., averaging, voting) Competition - DREAM challenges (http://dreamchallenges.org/) are competitions in biomedical sciences that use open clinical trial data to answer fundamental questions in biological science and human health. DREAM challenges last from 3 to 6 months. Anyone interested can join DREAM challenges. Teams who have the best-performing models will receive a reward [40] - Researchers in Guangzhou, China, organized a creative competition whereby participants contributed their ideas to develop a campaign to increase the HIV testing rate. Overall, 96 submissions were received after 39 days. A photo gallery was organized to celebrate the top five submissions. Winners were invited to join a panel of experts in the field of sexual health as recognition for their skills and knowledge [23] - Gives a well-defined problem to solve - Gives clear criteria for evaluation to recognize innovative ideas - Provides a strong communication plan for before, during, and after the competition. Uses different channels to publicize the competition in advance and provide real-time updates - Gives time to participants to understand the problem such as organizing an introduction workshop, providing a data set, and tutorials for training - Provides a forum for participants to exchange ideas and form their teams - Rewards for winners Play games - MalariaSpot (http://malariaspot.org/) is a web-based game in which participants detect malaria parasites in digitized blood samples. By playing games, participants recognize which blood images contain parasites and the types of malaria parasites. The results from the games help researchers increase the accuracy of malaria diagnosis [48] - Phylo (http://phylo.cs.mcgill.ca/) and Foldit (http://fold.it/portal/) are Web-based citizen science games allowing participants without a significant background in biology to contribute to the development of protein structures. The games are designed as small tasks with different level of difficulties. By playing the games, participants actually solve a problem in protein structures [25,26] - Web-based, mobile-based applications accessible to a wide range of participants - Provides tutorials to participants - Creates different levels of complexity - Real-time updates and leader boards are used to increase engagement from participants Collaboration - DocCHIRP is a crowdsourcing network of medical doctors that mobilizes the CI of their members to search for solutions to their medical questions [56] - Work is not able to be divided into independent pieces - Provides a platform for discussion, a way to record ideas from all participants (i.e., Wikis), and a moderator who supports the discussion - Provides tools to navigate ideas contributed by participants (i.e., text analysis) to identify patterns of ideas; automatic team matching Box 3 Challenges during the process of CI and proposed solutions Challenges Proposed solutions Challenges in recruitment Attracting a large number of participants and keeping them motivated Combine extrinsic motivation (i.e., financial rewards, recognition) with intrinsic motivation. There are different ways to trigger intrinsic motivation (i.e., using games to make taking part in tasks enjoyable for participants [48], encouraging participants to develop their knowledge, providing tutorials and giving participants opportunities to practice and develop new skills [27]) Challenges in communication Feeling of disappointment when participant's ideas are not implemented, feeling of being exploited Communicate clearly to participants the goals of organization, how the ideas will be used to contribute to the organization and community, and the implementation plan Lack of platform for idea sharing Create an online platform for participants to share ideas. Combined with automatic text analysis to provide real-time feedback, create a classification to keep track of all ideas and eliminate redundancy Dominant voices in the discussion Provide options for being anonymous in the discussion and a moderator to manage the platform, resolve conflicts, flag dominant voices, and arrange categories of ideas without intervening in the discussion Challenges in sustainability Difficulties in integrating ideas of participants in a business model Communicate clearly the goals of the organization, what the organization is looking for Time and resources required for screening and selecting ideas of participants Assign a dedicated staff (a moderator) to manage the classification of ideas, which can accelerate the evaluation process Lack of policy for data sharing Predefine terms of participation and communicate with participants for agreement on data sharing Box 4 Potential risks of mobilizing CI Internal validity Because most of the projects are open to the public, participants might not have adequate skills and knowledge to contribute meaningfully to research. This might have severe consequences if the contribution of unqualified participants influences decision-making, especially when it leads to changes in health care practices. Some projects added an extra step to assess the ability of participants. For example, the SPRINT data challenge had a qualification round to ensure that participants had certain skills to tackle the research problem [67]. This issue emphasizes the importance of an independent evaluation panel for objective assessment to adequately evaluate participants' contribution External validity Clear guidance is lacking on how many participants are needed to obtain relevant results. In our sample, the number of participants who actually contributed to the projects varied considerably, from 37 to 6200. This raised questions about the external validity of the contributions of participants and whether ideas or solutions generated and voted for by participants would be applicable to the community Risks related to privacy and personal data There are certain risks for participants when joining CI projects. When registering to be a member on intermediary platforms, participants might have to disclose their knowledge, but the platforms can use this knowledge without proper acknowledgment [69]. Similarly, ethical questions have been raised about online communities when data contributed voluntarily by patients has been sold for financial interests without informing patients [70] Intellectual property Participants in projects funded by academic institutions were not required to transfer exclusive copyright to organizers, and their contributions could be publicly accessible [17], whereas in projects funded by for-profit organizations, participants were obligated to transfer the copyright to organizers in exchange for monetary rewards. The latter case might imply some ethical risks. Organizations offered monetary rewards for only the highest ranked submissions, but in some cases, claimed ownership of all of submissions, which might cause a sense of mistrust in participants [71]. Hence, organizations should ensure the transparency of the terms of intellectual property Funding: This project is a part of a Methods in Research on Research (MiRoR) project that received funding from the European Union Horizon 2020 Research and Innovation programme, European Union under the Marie Sklodowska-Curie grant agreement no. 676207.

Hôpital Hôtel-Dieu 1 place du Parvis Notre-Dame Paris 75004 France Abstract Objectives New forms of research involving collective intelligence (CI) of diverse individuals mobilized through crowdsourcing is successfully emerging in various fields. This scoping review aimed to describe these methods across different fields and propose a framework for implementation. Study Design and Setting We searched seven electronic databases for reports describing projects that had mobilized CI with crowdsourcing. We used content analysis to develop themes and categories of the methods. Results We identified 145 reports. CI was mobilized to generate ideas, conduct evaluations, solve problems, and create intellectual outputs. Most projects (n = 110, 76%) were open to the public without restrictions on participants' expertise. Participants contributed to projects by independent contribution (i.e., no interaction with other participants) (n = 50, 34%), collaboration (n = 41, 28%), competitions (n = 33, 23%), and playing games (n = 16, 11%). In total, 61% of articles (n = 89) reported methods to evaluate participants' contribution and decision-making process: 43% used an independent panel of experts and 18% involved end users. We identified challenges in implementation and sustainability of CI and proposed solutions. Conclusion New research methods based on CI through crowdsourcing could transform clinical research. This framework facilitates the implementation of these methods. Keywords Clinical research Collective intelligence Crowdsourcing Interdisciplinary collaboration What is new? Key findings • New forms of research involving collective intelligence of diverse individuals mobilized through crowdsourcing is successfully emerging in various fields. • Collective intelligence and crowdsourcing offer the possibility to mobilize a large and diverse population through enhanced communication and collaboration, which could transform clinical research planning, conduct, and reporting. What this adds to what is known? • We provide an in-depth description of methods mobilizing collective intelligence with crowdsourcing in various fields. What is the implication and what should change now? • We propose a framework to implement these methods and highlight possible challenges and methodological issues. 1 Introduction New forms of research are needed to tackle the challenges that clinical research is facing [1,2]. Particularly, the methods currently used to identify the research question, choose the study design and outcome, and conduct the study are being questioned [3–6]. In addition, research has shown the need for better methods of public engagement in clinical research to increase research value [7,8]. In other research fields, new ways of doing research based on the concept of collective intelligence (CI) with crowdsourcing have been successfully implemented. With Climate CoLab, an initiative experimenting with new ideas to tackle climate change, more than 90,000 people have developed more than 2,000 research proposals within 7 years since its creation [9]. CI is defined as shared intelligence emerging from a group of people when they work on the same tasks that could result in more innovative outcomes than when individuals work alone [10,11]. CI is a cornerstone of science: researchers are collaborating on a day-to-day basis with other researchers within or outside of their team. However, with crowdsourcing, researchers are experiencing a new kind of CI that inclusively mobilizes people who are not usually involved in research. Crowdsourcing, whereby participants contribute different abilities such as analytical skills, technical knowledge, and creativity, could be applied to harness the CI of diverse stakeholders in clinical research. To determine whether CI with crowdsourcing could change how research is planned, conducted, and reported, we need an in-depth understanding of how it is being used in different fields. In this study, we aimed to describe methods of mobilizing CI with crowdsourcing in different fields and propose a framework to implement them. 2 Method We conducted a scoping review drawing on a previously published framework [12,13]. First, we systematically identified original research articles that described projects across different disciplines that had applied methods of CI. Second, we classified the methods described in each article by answering the following questions: what were the reasons for using CI; who participated and what were their motivations; and what was the process of mobilizing CI in terms of organization, communication, evaluation of participants' contributions and decision-making. 2.1 Definition of CI with crowdsourcing In this study, we defined CI with crowdsourcing as shared intelligence emerging when mobilizing people who are usually not involved in the research process to work on a specific task [11]. 2.2 Search strategy and information sources We searched the English-language articles in the following standard databases: PubMed, Web of Science; Scopus; EBSCO Business Source Premier; EBSCO Academic Source Premier; publication resources of the Center for Collective Intelligence, Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) (search date December 03, 2016); and Google Scholar (January 11, 2017). We also hand-searched databases of funders who support innovation in health research such as PCORI, NIHR, Robert Wood Johnson, Horizon 2020, FP7, and Laboratory for Innovation Science at Harvard (search date December 03, 2018). Search terms were “collective intelligence,” crowdsource/crowdsourcing/crowdsourced, “open innovation,” “peer production.” To increase the precision of the search, search terms were limited to the titles of articles. We also searched Google Scholar for Wikimedia, WikiProject Medicine, and Task Exchange by Cochrane (search date December 03, 2018). The search strategy for each database is presented in Appendix 1. We did not restrict the search by publication date, study design, or study setting. 2.3 Eligibility criteria Reports were eligible if they reported a project that had applied methods of CI with crowdsourcing as previously defined [11]. We excluded articles without abstracts, conference proceedings, and protocols without results. We also excluded articles about using crowdsourcing to collect data or perform simple tasks such as classifying images or transcribing data because this did not specifically involve intellectual thinking on the part of the crowd. Theoretical articles and studies using mathematical models to simulate different virtual scenarios of CI were also excluded. Reports of literature reviews were retrieved, and the reference lists were screened to identify eligible reports. 2.4 Identification process One researcher (V.T.N.) screened the titles and abstracts of all retrieved citations and the full text of all relevant citations identified. A second reviewer checked 10% of excluded citations to ensure the quality of the process. Overall, 300 reports were double checked; disagreements were resolved after discussion (Cohen's kappa coefficient = 0.97 [95% confidence interval 0.954–0.986]). 2.5 Data charting process We applied content analysis to inductively develop themes and categories for each domain. We also relied on the framework from MIT's Center for Collective Intelligence and published work on crowdsourcing to ensure that our themes described essential domains to understand methods of CI [10,14]. First, two researchers (V.T.N and I.B.) read a set of 20 articles to identify themes describing the methods used for each domain. The two researchers then met to reach consensus on the themes to be included in a data extraction form. Second, one researcher (V.T.N.) used this initial set of themes to extract data from another set of 20 articles. The second researcher (I.B.) cross-checked the data collected and the themes to ensure that the themes covered the information needed. Then, two researchers (V.T.N. and L.G.) extracted data from a set of 33% of articles included, with consensus achieved in case of discrepancies (pooled Cohen's kappa coefficient = 0.63 [95% confidence interval 0.42–0.83]), and one researcher (V.T.N.) extracted data from all remaining articles included. Any new themes emerging during data extraction were recorded and discussed with the senior researcher (I.B.), thereby refining and enriching the list of themes. 2.6 Data items We extracted the following data from the titles, abstracts, methods, results, and conclusions of retrieved reports. 2.6.1 Publication characteristics Publication characteristics were title, year of publication, author, type of article (reports of original research, methodological papers), field of study (computer science and technology, biomedicine and other fields including economics, finance and business; environmental science; education; media and communication; psychology and social science), and funding sources. 2.6.2 Methods of CI To understand the methods of CI, we extracted information for seven domains: (1) reasons for using CI, (2) type of participants and methods of recruitment, (3) motivation, (4) type of participants' contribution, (5) type of interaction between participants, (6) methods to evaluate participants' contribution and decision-making on what ideas or solutions to use, and (7) challenges of CI reported by authors and authors' satisfaction with participants' contributions. 2.7 Critical appraisal We did not assess bias because neither the Joanna Briggs Institute framework [13] nor the PRISMA checklist for scoping reviews [15] require assessment of risk of bias because scoping reviews aim to provide an overview of the existing evidence regardless of the risk of bias of primary evidence. Furthermore, no validated tool is available for the critical appraisal of research using CI. Nevertheless, we assessed the quality of reporting for the following items: type of participants, sample size, demographic information, motivations for participants, evaluation methods, challenges and limitations. 2.8 Patients and public involvement Patients and the public were not involved in this scoping review. 2.9 Statistical analysis We used R v3.4.2 (the R Foundation Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria) to compute frequencies and percentages for each method. Qualitative data extracted from articles were coded by content analysis and inductively grouped to create categories. 3 Results 3.1 Study identification and general characteristics We retrieved 3,780 citations from the electronic search and excluded 3,395 based on titles and abstracts. Two further articles were excluded as the full texts could not be found. After reviewing the reference lists of literature reviews retrieved from the search, we identified five more eligible articles. We assessed the full texts of 383 articles, and 145 articles from 145 projects were eligible for data extraction (Fig. 1 ): 49 from biomedicine, 47 from computer science and technology, and 49 from other fields (Additional File 2). Overall, 89 projects received funding from not-for-profit organizations (i.e., funding from academic institutions, nongovernmental organizations, philanthropic and charity organizations, public funders) [16], 13 from for-profit organizations, and 2 from crowdfunding; 41 articles did not report funding sources. 3.2 Reasons for using CI From 145 included articles, we identified and classified the following four main reasons for using CI: • Create intellectual outputs (n = 65 projects, 45%): Participants contribute to the creation of health education materials, clinical trial protocols, prognostic models, software, articles, and policies. • Generate ideas (n = 38, 26%): Participants contribute to new ideas for research and development. For example, Harvard Medical School launched idea challenges to generate new research questions on type I diabetes [17]. • Conduct evaluations (n = 10, 7%): Participants evaluate the quality of the ideas/work. CI is mobilized to critically appraise research quality. • Solve problems (n = 25, 17%): Participants solve a practical problem and propose solutions to difficulties given by organizers. For example, CI of experts from 26 different European countries is being mobilized for the clinical diagnosis of very rare genetic syndromes of multiple congenital anomalies [18]. Six articles (4%) described mobilizing CI for both generating ideas and conduct evaluations; one article (1%) aimed to create intellectual outputs and conduct evaluations. Box 1 provides examples for each reason for using CI in biomedicine. 3.3 Type of participants and methods of recruitment Participants could be classified into three categories (1): open public (n = 110, 76%) (everyone can contribute regardless of their background) (2): experts in the field (n = 21, 14%); and (3) defined groups (n = 14, 10%) (a specific population relevant to the research topic, such as students or patients). Participant demographic information (e.g., sex, education, economic status) was reported in only 16 articles (11%). The number of participants contributing to the projects was reported in 59 articles (41%). When reported, the median number of participants who contributed to the projects was 242 [Q1–Q3: 111–535]. The methods used to recruit participants were reported in 50 articles and included creating a Website or mobile phone applications, combined with an open call in social media platforms (60%) [21,27–29], using personal networks and offline communities (22%) [30–32], targeting online communities (PatientsLikeMe, www.reddit.com) (6%) [33–35], contracting with crowdsourcing intermediary platforms (i.e., online platforms connecting organizations wishing to leverage CI with a readily available community) (InnoCentive, Kaggle) (6%) [17,19,36], and recruiting on crowdsourcing marketplaces (Amazon Mechanical Turk) (6%) [37,38]. 3.4 Motivation In total, 108 articles (74%) reported the incentives or intrinsic factors used to motivate participants to take part in the projects. Financial incentives were the most common (n = 42, 39%) [27,36,39,40], followed by recognition from the network (n = 8, 7%) [18,41] and access to data (n = 2, 2%) [42,43]. Intrinsic motivation could sometimes have a role; for example, participation in a project could arise from individuals' sense of belonging to a network (n = 17, 16%) [23,44], personal interest in the topic and gaining new knowledge (n = 17, 16%) [45,46], fun (n = 12, 11%) [25,47,48], and altruism (n = 4, 4%) [31,49]. Six articles (6%) reported a combination of both incentives and intrinsic motivation. 3.5 How participants contributed to the projects We identified four methods by which participants contributed to projects: independent contribution (collection) (i.e., participants work independently to complete small pieces of work) (n = 50 projects, 34%) [21,32,34]; competition (i.e., participants submit their work independently, only good solutions are selected and rewarded) (n = 33, 23%) [23,27,36]; the use of a game to collect independent contributions from participants while creating fun and enjoyment (n = 16, 11%) [25,47,48]; and collaboration (i.e., participants work interdependently and collaboratively to complete tasks together) (n = 41, 28%) [50,51]. One project (1%) combined competition with independent contribution [52]. Participants joined the competition to generate ideas and then the community was involved in evaluating the ideas independently. Four projects (3%) combined competition with collaboration: the project first organized a competition and then held a workshop at which the leading teams collaborated to create better solutions [33,53–55]. Box 2 provides examples of each type of contribution in biomedical projects. 3.6 Interactions between participants and organizers A total of 64 articles (44%) described no interaction among participants or between participants and organizers (stand-alone). For 54 projects (37%), participants could receive feedback from other participants and for 20 (14%), from organizers. Other methods for interaction between participants and organizers included online focus group discussion (n = 7, 5%). 3.7 Evaluation of participants' contribution and decision-making process Although 98 (68%) articles claimed that authors were satisfied with participants' contributions, only 89 (61%) reported methods to evaluate the contribution and decision-making for selecting the best contributions. We identified two main categories: evaluation and decision by an independent panel (n = 63, 43%) and evaluation and decision by end users (target customers, community members) (n = 26, 18%). For example, Harvard Medical School launched an idea competition on diabetes and used a panel of 142 faculty members to review the 150 submissions and select the best one [17]. In Dell's IdeaStorm, community members gave points to each idea [44]; the evaluation was based on average points from all participants. 3.8 Challenges of mobilizing CI Among 145 articles reviewed, only 13 mentioned the challenges encountered when using CI. Most of the challenges concerned two main issues: (1) implementation of CI projects and (2) sustainability (Box 3 ). Regarding challenges in implementation, two articles discussed difficulties in recruitment and participant retention [56,57]. Two articles described challenges in communicating with participants, including lack of a platform for exchanging ideas among participants, dominant voices in the discussion, unclear communication from organizers causing mistrust and a feeling of being exploited, and unclear idea expression from participants, which slowed the idea selection [44,58]. Two articles emphasized the importance of making the research questions understandable to participants and provided participants with adequate information to address the problems posed [27,59]. One article discussed the issues of selecting inappropriate comparison standards when evaluating participant contributions [60]. Seven articles highlighted the challenges in sustaining the integration of CI in traditional business models, including resources and changes in the organization's culture when integrating new ideas from participants [44,54]; increased workload for organizers to prepare tasks for participants, screen and select the best solutions [56,61]; and the need for policies on data sharing and how participants could access data contributed by other participants [56,62]. 3.9 A framework to mobilize CI Fig. 2 presents types of participants, how participants contributed to projects, interactions among participants, and the evaluation of participants' contributions and decision-making according to the different reasons for using CI. To generate evaluation and solve problems, independent contributions were used often, with mostly no interaction among participants. In contrast, competition was often used to generate ideas, and participants were able to exchange ideas and receive feedback from each other. To create intellectual products, participants collaborated with each other and were able to receive feedback from other participants and organizers to improve their products. Considering all the information recorded, in Fig. 3 , we propose a framework of the process of mobilizing CI. The framework describes seven steps in the process and the classification of methods for each step. 4 Discussion This scoping review provides an in-depth description of methods mobilizing CI with crowdsourcing and proposes a framework to implement these methods in research. In this review, we defined CI with crowdsourcing as shared intelligence that emerges when people who are usually not involved in research are mobilized to work on a specific task. Some literature considers crowdsourcing used to collect data and perform simple tasks as a kind of CI [10,63]. However, in this study, we focused on research harnessing CI whereby participants contribute their intellectual abilities. CI relies on the principles of the wisdom of the crowd and “swarm” intelligence. The wisdom of the crowd theory states that decisions resulting from the aggregation of information from a large crowd of independent individuals are often better than those from any single member of the group [64]. Wisdom of the crowd is particularly relevant to evaluation and decision-making. Swarm intelligence emerges when the interaction of independent individuals produces better problem-solving abilities than a single individual [65,66]. Swarm intelligence is used to generate ideas, solve problems, and create intellectual products. By applying principles of CI and by using an online interface to crowdsource to a large population, clinical research might be accelerated and enriched by innovation. CI can be applied to support different stages of clinical research (e.g., identify research questions, design interventions, develop research protocols, analyze data, and appraise research quality). Examples include a Harvard Medical School challenge to leverage the wisdom of crowd to identify pioneering ideas for type I diabetes research [17]. Similarly, the New England Journal of Medicine launched the SPRINT data challenge to give data scientists across the world the opportunity to access and analyze clinical trial data [67]. Cochrane crowd and CrowdCARE are initiatives that use the power of the crowd to reduce the research burden and accelerate the process of evidence synthesis [24,68]. To our knowledge, this scoping review is the first study to systematically describe the methods of mobilizing CI with crowdsourcing in published research across different fields. Our results show that some essential information is missing from reports of research involving CI. Half of the articles did not report the number of participants contributing to the project, and demographic information on participants was reported in just 10% of articles. This hinders verification of claims made about the diversity of participants and regarding the irrelevance to the problem. There are several potential risks of bias related to CI that we discuss in Box 4 . The literature on CI might entail risk of reporting bias. Overall, 68% (98/145) of articles stated positive outcomes from mobilizing CI, but only 9% reported difficulties encountered. In all, 28% (40/145) did not report sources of funding. Most retrieved publications were funded by not-for-profit organizations (61%), indicating that projects using methods of CI funded by for-profit-organizations might be underreported. Hence, funders and researchers must be encouraged to publish their research to contribute to the knowledge base and thereby assist methodological improvement. Our scoping review has some limitations. First, we restricted our search to keywords in titles to reduce the number of irrelevant articles, so we might have missed some reports that contained keywords elsewhere in the text. However, our aim was to provide a description of different methods of mobilizing CI rather than exhaustively review all relevant articles or report multiple repetitions of the same methods. Second, we focused on published literature, and some projects involving CI may not result in a classical scientific publication. Third, because no validated tool for critical appraisal was available, we were not able to assess the quality of research reports involving CI. 5 Conclusion In conclusion, we describe methods to mobilize CI across different disciplines and a framework to implement these methods. For researchers who want to apply CI, this framework could be useful to select appropriate methods. Nevertheless, more research is needed to further understand the conditions that enable and constrain the success of CI.
