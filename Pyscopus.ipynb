These materials are of special interest due to their low density, high porosity, and surface area. This chapter presents a brief historic overview of aerogels, then switches to the nanocarbon aerogels consisting of CNT, GN, nanodiamonds, etc. The various techniques for preparing nanocarbon aerogels and their composites have also been discussed. The characterizations of these fascinating materials have been briefly described to get an overview of the porous network and different fabrication possibilities. Finally, the applications of nanocarbon aerogel composites have been discussed in the field of environmental remediation such as gas sensing, adsorptive removal of pollutants, photocatalytic degradation, and the energy sector.

Aerogels possess a specific geometrical structure and thus are not a specific mineral or material with a set chemical formula [2]. These are extremely branched materials and the structure is solid foam with high porosity and connectivity. Due to this high connectivity, it can take many different shapes and forms. Until now the majority of the works on aerogels have been done on silica-based materials, but other materials such as semiconducting metal oxides, polymers, noble metals, etc., have also been found to form aerogels [3–5]. Aerogels consist of very little solid material and internally the structure is nothing but air. This unique structural composition gives it a ghostly appearance, and hence it is also called frozen smoke [6]. Kistler first introduced the concept of aerogels by using supercritical drying conditions to remove the liquid by air in a wet gel; his work was published in the journal Nature in 1931 in just a half-page [7]. He showed that, at a certain critical point, the liquid phase can be completely removed without disturbing the structure and the formation of liquid-vapor interfaces. Also, the capillary forces that subsequently collapse the drying gel to xerogel can be avoided. Due to this supercritical drying condition, the aerogel retains high porosity, low density, and high surface area [8]. The Kistler method of preparing aerogels was cumbersome, and this field largely went uninvestigated until the 1960s when Teichner and Nicolaon prepared aerogels by what is now commonly known as the sol-gel process. The technique developed by Teichner and Nicolaon eliminated the time-consuming salt removal and solvent-exchange steps. They succeeded in producing silica aerogels by using silicon alkoxide and thus trigging the aerogel synthesis in hours rather than days [9]. This advancement in technique triggered research in the synthesis and design of a wide variety of simple and complex aerogel structures, including inorganic materials (SiO2, TiO2, ZnO, ZrO2) [10], noble metals (Ag, Au) [11], organic materials (i.e., resorcinol-formaldehyde, polyimide, polystyrene, conducting polymers such as polyaniline or polypyrrole, etc.), [12] carbonaceous materials (i.e., charcoal, carbon black, carbon nanotubes (CNT), graphene (GN)) [13,14], semiconductor chalcogenide (i.e., ZnS, PbS, CdS, CdSe, PbTe) [15], natural-based aerogels (i.e., cellulose and proteins) [16,17], and, more recently, SiC-based aerogels [18]. Besides the interesting properties of these single-component aerogels, their composite with a specific component has often conferred an additional functionality such as, for example, high mechanical strength, good hydrophobicity, and catalytic features in comparison to the pristine materials, which makes them applicable to high-performance applications in various sectors such as energy harvesting, environmental remediation, sensors, etc. [19–22]. Among a large number of aerogels, the carbon material-based aerogels are rather promising as they have the possibility of a large number of tunable diverse morphologies as well as hierarchical porosity, a large specific surface area, and the interconnected network that endows it with high electrical properties [23]. Carbon aerogels consisting of CNT, GN, etc., have been largely employed in various fields as they possess a high surface area to form the electric double layer and have good electrochemical oxidation/reduction stability [24]. The high porosity and possibilities of chemical functionalization make it a promising material for the adsorptive removal of pollutants and the sensing of volatile organic compounds [25,26]. In view of all these, the present chapter gives a brief overview of different types of nanocarbon aerogels and their composites, their structural morphology, and the synthesis and major developments in their applications in different fields. The compiled work does not cover all the developments in the above-mentioned fields, but it gives a basic understanding of the major developments and progress in this field. For the sake of convenience, the chapter is divided into different categories, depending on the field of application. 1.2 Different types of nanocarbon aerogels Nanocarbon materials consist of CNT, GN, nanodiamond (ND), fullerenes, etc. There are different ways in which these nanocarbon materials and aerogels have come together. First, aerogels can be made using these carbonaceous materials or different types of aerogels can be reinforced with embedded nanocarbon materials. Nanocarbon aerogels have the advantage of having diverse macroscopic morphology, hierarchical porosity, and a large surface area. The interconnected framework of three-dimensional (3D) carbon gives them excellent electrical properties, which make them a promising material for a variety of applications [23]. 1.2.1 CNT aerogels Silica, polymers, carbonaceous materials, metal, and metal oxides have been used to fabricate aerogels [27–29], but fabrication of pure carbonaceous materials such as CNT aerogels has been a tedious job for scientists, who have achieved only modest success so far [30,31]. Ya-Li Li et al. [32] showed that the gaseous phase during CNT synthesis can be wound into continuous fibers of endless length. It was found that the continuous fibers formed an aerogel and gave an appearance of elastic smoke. The continuous spinning is possible in the case of a variety of carbon sources such as methanol, ethanol, ethers, acetones, etc. The structure of CNT aerogels is widely dependent on the carbon sources and alcohol and ketones gave continuous fibers while carbon particles, thick fibers, or a mixture of both was obtained in the case of mixed hydrocarbons such as petroleum. A report from Shen et al. [33] used simple CNT raw powders dispersed in water with surfactant sodium dodecyl benzene sulfonate to form aerogels. The optimum ratio of CNT, surfactant, and water under ultrasonic waves coagulated into gel, which was washed and dried under supercritical conditions to give CNT aerogels. This simple fabrication methodology has been presented in Fig. 1.1 . 1.2.2 Graphene aerogels GN aerogels are generally produced from graphene oxide (GO) [34] due to its high functionality and ability to form uniform aqueous dispersion. Due to the presence of oxygen-containing groups in the basal planes and edges, it can covalently react with different materials, which gives the possibility of synthesizing new materials with a completely different set of properties [34]. The GO can be reduced into GN aerogel by hydrothermal methodology, reducing agents, or a combination of both. The GN aerogel is a highly porous and extremely lightweight material consisting of aggregated sheets of GN; it also possesses high mechanical strength [35]. Xu et al. [36] showed that GN can be self-assembled into highly porous macroscopic GN architectures by a simple heating of GO under hydrothermal methodology. The aerogels showed high mechanical properties and conductivity in the range of 5×10−3 S/cm due to the generation of a conjugated structure upon reduction. The advantage of this methodology in contrast to others is that the formation of a macroporous gel-like structure and a reduction occur simultaneously [37,38]. Cheng et al. [13] showed that further high-temperature treatment of GN aerogel by hydrothermal methodology at 1500°C resulted in improvement in the conductivity, mechanical properties, oxidation temperature, and electric conductivity of the GN aerogels. Fig. 1.2 represents the fabrication of a GN aerogel by hydrothermal methodology and its further treatment at 1500°C, which gives a GN aerogel with improved properties. GO can also be reduced by chemical as well as electrochemical methods using hydrazine, vitamin C, sodium ascorbate, mercaptoacetic acid, mercaptoethanol, etc. [39,40]. However, these reduction methodologies often lead to a less-porous GN aerogel due to high stacking between the GN sheets. 1.2.3 CNT and graphene aerogels composite Polymers have been widely used as binding materials to withstand the 3D structures of carbonaceous aerogels [41]. CNT aerogels with a sodium carboxymethylcellulose binder showed a low density of ~32.7–77.7mg/cm3, high mechanical strength, electrical conductivity of ~0.034–0.162S/cm and ultralow thermal diffusivity of ~2.09–4.54mm2/s. The binder plays a very important role for the formation of aerogels. The SEM images of carboxymethylcellulose binder freeze dried under liquid nitrogen shows the formation of spindly stripes due to its polymer chain structure. Thus, it can be inferred that the binder and CNTs entangle with each other to synergistically construct the hierarchical microstructures of the CNT aerogels [42]. Fig. 1.3 shows the role of the carboxymethylcellulose binder in the formation of binder-supported CNT aerogels. The entrapment of CNT into dendritic polymers was also reported by Zhang et al. [43] to get highly functionalized 3D hydrogel networks. The individual nanotubes were assembled with poly(amido amine) in the presence of Fe3O4 nanoparticles to give the 3D poly(amido amine) entangled CNT and Fe3O4 composites. Similarly, a lot of progress has been made in producing a variety of CNT-based aerogel composites as porous supporting binders that can be easily tailored to meet needs by incorporating different metals, metal oxides, etc. [44,45] GOs have been widely utilized to prepare GN aerogel composites with metal, metal oxides, polymers, etc. The dispersion of the metal, metal oxides, polymers, or their precursors in the GO dispersion and their further hydrothermal reduction with or without a reducing agent has been widely utilized to get a wide variety of GN aerogel composites. Guo et al. [46] hydrolyzed ZrOCl2.8H2O in a GO/dimethyl formamide solution to form the gel precursors, which was followed by supercritical drying with CO2 and carbonization in argon to give GN/ZrO2 aerogels. Peng Lv et al. [47] deposited polyaniline by electrochemical methodology on superelastic GN aerogels to get GN/polyaniline aerogel composites. Similarly, a ternary composite of GN aerogels can be prepared by mixing two different materials in the GO dispersion followed by the hydrothermal reduction of GO. The self-assembled GN/polyaniline/Co3O4 ternary hybrid aerogels by Lin et al. [48] utilized a universal strategy. First, a GO/polyaniline composite was prepared by in situ polymerization. A subsequent self-assembly of the GO/polyaniline composite in the presence of GO/cobalt salts hybrid was done by hydrothermal treatment to fabricate a novel 3D macroporous framework of GN/polyaniline/Co3O4. Similarly, different combinations of polymers (polypyrrole, polythiophene, nonconducting polymers) and nanomaterials (metal/metal oxides) can be used to prepare the GN aerogel with interesting properties [49–52]. 1.2.4 Nanodiamond based aerogels The ND aerogel is expected to have a wide tunable optical index of refraction (∼1< n <2.4), which can be used for synthesizing antireflection coatings as well as electrical field emission applications while maintaining its low density along with the high surface area and self-supporting aerogel morphology. The synthesis of the ND aerogel at high temperature and pressure from an amorphous carbon aerogel was demonstrated by Pauzauskiea et al. [53] using a laser-heated diamond anvil cell. Chemically inert neon was used to prevent the collapse of the structure by filling the aerogel's void volume. The microscopic images revealed that the highly porous aerogel morphology of the precursor was well preserved in the ND aerogel, and the electron diffraction confirmed the conversion from amorphous carbon to cubic diamond. Fig 1.4 shows the TEM images and diffraction patterns of the ND aerogel. The sol-gel process using a reaction between resorcinol and formaldehyde molecular precursors gave macroscopic ND aerogel materials with high surface areas based on acid-catalyzed condensation reactions in a polar aprotic solvent (acetonitrile). The large pore size obtained in this methodology suggests a wide range of applications of ND aerogels in energy storage, catalysis, pharmaceuticals, etc. [54]. The ND aerogel composite was reported by Roldan et al. [55] by a similar reduction of GO in the presence of ND, as discussed earlier. The support of ND on GN prevented the restacking of GN and the agglomeration of ND at the same time. 1.3 Nanocarbon aerogels for energy storage applications Supercapacitors have emerged recently as a sustainable, low-cost, and high-power energy source for applications in devices needing uninterruptible energy requirements, such as electrical vehicles and renewable energy systems [56]. Carbon materials exhibit lower energy density than pseudocapacitors and thus pseudocapacitors have attracted much attention in recent years. In order to utilize the beneficial properties of carbonaceous materials, hybrid electrode materials have been proposed [57]. The mesoporous morphology of carbon materials has been largely employed as electrode-active materials due to their high surface area. However, these porous structures suffer from defects such as a complicated and disordered porous structure, which affects the electron transfer and thus limits the performance of the devices [58, 59]. In the viewpoint of the above-mentioned problems, carbon material aerogels (CNT, GN, and ND) that are composed of 3D networks of interconnected nanoparticles offer high porosity with large pore volumes, high surface areas, and tunable porosity. Binderless single-walled CNT aerogels prepared by Katherine L. Van Aken et al. [60] showed high ratios of surface area to volume and strength to weight. The single-walled CNT aerogels showed high capacitive performance over 10,000 cycles as well as an impressive performance at high charge and discharge rates, which was attributed to its accessible pore networks and enhanced electronic and ionic conductivities. CNT aerogel composites with metal and their salts also showed promising energy storage applications. Acid treated CNTs in combination with V2O5 sol was successfully fabricated into aerogels by Wu et al. [61]. Due to their hierarchical porous structure, high specific surface area, and good electrical conductivity, the V2O5-CNT-based supercapacitors demonstrated extremely high specific capacitance, high power and energy densities, and excellent cycling stability. A similar high performance has also been reported for cobalt disulfide nanoparticles/GN/CNT aerogels and 3D NiCo2O4/multiwalled CNT nanocomposite aerogels prepared by a supercritical CO2 drying method [62, 63]. Zheng et al. [64] showed high energy-storage performances in their highly flexible aerogels consisting of cellulose nanofibril, reduced GO [32], and CNT fabricated without any binders, current collectors, or electroactive additives. Because of the porous structure of the cellulose nanofibril/rGO/CNT aerogel electrodes and the excellent electrolyte absorption properties of the cellulose nanofibril present in the aerogel electrodes, the resulting flexible supercapacitors exhibited a high specific capacitance (i.e., 252Fg−1 at a discharge current density of 0.5Ag−1) and a remarkable cycle stability (i.e., more than 99.5% of the capacitance was retained after 1000 charge-discharge cycles at a current density of 1Ag−1). Furthermore, the supercapacitors also showed extremely high areal capacitance, areal power density, and energy density (i.e., 216mFcm−2, 9.5mWcm−2, and 28.4μWhcm−2, respectively). Instead of rGO, when polyaniline was used, a high specific capacitance of 791.13F/g was obtained at 0.2A/g. The polyaniline nanoparticles deposited on the surface of cellulose nanofibril and CNTs connected to form a continuous network, which increased the charge mobility, hence resulting in high electroactivity [65]. The rGO aerogels show very high supercapacitive performance in aqueous electrolytes due to their plentiful mesopores and macroporous structures. Weijiang Si et al. [66] calculated their specific capacitance in KOH and H2SO4 to be 211.8 and 278.6Fg−1, respectively. Thus, the mesoporosity highly affects the conductance and supercapacitive nature of electrodes. The GN aerogels synthesized by Hummers’ method by thermal treatment of GO with resorcinol-formaldehyde gel was found to possess pore volume and surface area of 2.96cm3/g and 584m2/g, respectively. Due to that, a high electrical conductance of 87S/m was obtained [67]. Zhang et al. [37] successfully obtained 512m2/g surface area and high electrical conductivity of ~102 S/m. These highly conductive aerogels exhibited a specific capacitance of 128F/g. Functionalized GN such as nitrogen-doped GN aerogels functionalized with melamine showed high specific capacitance of 170.5Fg−1 at 0.2Ag−1, along with the high charge/discharge cycling stability [68]. The p-phenylenediamine functionalized GN aerogel by Habib Gholipour-Ranjbar et al. [69] showed porous 3D structures and with an increase in the content of p-phenylenediamine, an increase in the surface area was observed. Their study revealed an excellent capacitance of 385Fg−1 at a discharge current density of 1Ag−1, along with the exceptionally high cyclic stability by displaying a 25% increase in specific capacitance after 5000 cycles. The aerogels with larger pore size showed enhanced supercapacitive performance compared with the aerogels with smaller pore size. Metal/metal oxide composites with GN aerogels allow the access of electrolytes inside the porous aerogel structures, which results in enhanced diffusion and migration of electrolyte ions during the rapid charge/discharge process. The 3D MnO2/GN aerogel by Ji et al. [70] showed a high specific capacitance of 200Fg–1. As p-phenylenediamine helps in the formation of a porous 3D structure, the p-phenylenediamine functionalized MnO2/GN aerogel showed excellent performance of 26.2Whkg−1 energy density and high cyclic stability after 5000 cycles. The enhanced performance is due to the improved electrolyte accessibility owing to high porosity and utilization of the highest surface area of the electrode materials. Due to its porous structure, cellulose yielded high porosity in the cellulose/GN aerogels, which is expected to provide efficient migration of electrolyte ions and electrons. Zhang et al. [71] found the specific capacitances of cellulose/GN aerogels to be 300F/g at a scan rate of 5mV/s. Conducting polymers such as polyaniline and polypyrrole have also shown superior electrochemical properties. This excellent electrochemical performance is due to the synergistic contribution of the local conductivity of GN layers sandwiched between polyaniline layers and the long-distance conductivity of 3D GN frameworks. Qu et al. [72] showed a high specific surface area of up to 337m2/g for symmetric and asymmetric all-solid-state supercapacitors, and the aerogels delivered areal capacitances up to 453 and 679mF/cm2, respectively, which was found to be superior to most of the GN/GO or polyaniline-based aerogels [73]. GN/polypyrrole nanoparticle hybrid aerogels with a 3D hierarchical porous structure exhibited high specific capacitance (418Fg−1) at a current density of 0.5Ag−1, extremely outstanding rate capability (80%) at various current densities from 0.5 to 20Ag−1, and good cycling performance (74%) after 2000 cycles [49]. Ye et al. [74] showed that polypyrrole nanotubes not only provided a large accessible surface area for fast transport of hydrate ions but also acted as spacers to prevent the restacking of GN sheets. Their 3D hierarchical GN/polypyrrole aerogels showed high specific capacitance up to 253Fg−1, good rate performance, and outstanding cycle stability. Thus it can be concluded that GN aerogels have a large number of possibilities for chemical functionalization and composite fabrication with metal/metal oxides, polymers, etc., that can give different type of GN-based aerogels with hitherto unreported properties. These materials are easy to fabricate and hold tremendous potential in solving the energy crisis of the present era. 1.4 Nanocarbon aerogel adsorbents for wastewater remediation The growth of industrialization and various human activities are responsible for the release of different types of organic, inorganic, and biological contaminants into surface water. To avoid health problems, the elimination of these contaminants is necessary. Adsorption is the well-known method for the removal of impurities present in wastewater. The low operation cost and easy handling of the process make this method most promising. Until now, a lot of the adsorbents have been investigated for environmental remediation applications and many commercially available sorbent materials such as biomass, activated carbons, metal oxides, minerals and clays, polymers, and so forth have been used. An ideal adsorbent must have the following properties: • Low cost and high adsorption capacity. • High surface area, porosity, and large pore volume. • High chemical and physical stability. • Easy to modify. • Easy separation from aquatic medium. • Ability to attain ultralow contaminant levels in treated streams. • High reusability capacity. Among the various types of adsorbents, the aerogel adsorbents are getting the attention of researchers while having most of the aforementioned properties of an ideal adsorbent. Aerogel microstructures usually are hydrophobic in nature, having well-defined 3D structures. The exceptionally high surface area, porosity, low density, and flexible surface chemistry of the aerogels makes them an effective and efficient sorbents for the scavenging of pollutants from aqueous solutions [75]. The major advantage of aerogel as an adsorbent is its macro size that can be easily removed from an aqueous solution compared to the nanostructured powdered materials. In the past, different types of aerogels have been prepared and used for the removal of various kinds of contaminants from wastewater such as carbons, metal oxides, polymers, and so forth. Currently, carbon-based aerogel adsorbents are getting much attention due to their high surface area and high adsorption capacity. Several studies showed that powdered carbons such as activated carbon, CNT, and GN are efficient adsorbents for the removal of organic, inorganic, and biological contaminates from wastewater. The physical and adsorption properties of the aerogels highly depend on the method of synthesis and the parent materials used for the preparation. For example, Wang et al. [76] and Li et al. [77] prepared a cellulose-based carbon aerogel adsorbent and investigated its application for the removal of dyes and metals from an aquatic medium. Wang et al. [76] used a combination of aqueous LiOH/urea/H2O (4.6:19:76.4w/w) and different wt% of cellulose. The cellulose hydrogel was exchanged with deionized water, ethanol, and t-butanol followed by N2 freeze drying. The obtained cellulose aerogels were heated under N2 flow at 800°C for 1h to convert it into a carbon aerogel. The surface area by the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller technique (SBET) of the carbon aerogel was 500m2/g, the mesopores were 30–50nm, and the density was 20mg/cm3. The adsorption capacities of the carbon aerogels for different dyes were in the range of 195–1947mg/g, higher than other types of activated carbon. The adsorption capacity of the carbon aerogels was 801 and 182mg/g for the Cu (II) and Sn (II), respectively, while carbon aerogels were inactive for Zn (II) and Ni (II) adsorption. Compared to Wang et al. [76], cellulose-based carbon aerogels prepared by Li et al. [77] showed different properties and adsorption efficiency. Li and coworkers [77] used the NaOH/urea/H2O (7:12:81), NaCl, and isooctyl alcohol ether phosphate. The obtained gel was freeze dried at −55°C for 48h followed by carbonization at 600°C for 2h. However, the SBET of the carbon aerogel was higher (725.12m2/g) compared to the Wang et al. [76] study (SBET =500m2/g), but the adsorption capacity of the carbon aerogel was much lower (55.25mg/g). By comparing these studies, it can be concluded that the adsorption properties of the aerogel highly depend on the method of preparation and applied experimental conditions. Besides the carbon, CNTs and GO have been widely used as adsorbents due to their high surface area, low density, and abundant oxygeneous functional groups. However, the agglomeration is the biggest problem associated with CNTs and GO. Making the 3D aerogel framework of the GO, CNTs, and GO/CNTs nanocomposite may be the best solution to prevent the agglomeration and improve the surface area and porosity. Wan and coworkers [78] prepared the ultralow density (6.2–2.8mg/cm3) GN-CNTs aerogel and applied it as an adsorbent for the removal of oil, organic dyes, and solvents. The results showed that the prepared aerogel was highly efficient and can adsorb 100–270 times of its own weight, depending on the density of the adsorbed organics. Moreover, the efficiency of the aerogel was not changed up to 10 cycles. The hybrid aerogel based on the GN sheet and nanoribbons was synthesized by Wang et al. [79]. The synthesized hybrid aerogels showed the largest adsorption capacity for the organic solvent and oils, as shown in Fig. 1.5 . The aerogel was able to adsorb ~100–350 times its weight with excellent recyclability. 1.5 Nanocarbon aerogel photocatalyst for wastewater remediation Photocatalysis is an advanced oxidation process that has received significant attention due to its low energy requirements and easy operation to break down the organic contaminants into mineral products. Due to the abundance of solar light, semiconductor-based heterogeneous photocatalysis is considered one of the most encouraging technologies for resolving environmental contamination. Although photocatalysis is an advanced and effective technology, there are some problems related to the photocatalyst materials, such as: • Most of the semiconductor materials are not visible light active or show poor activity. • High band gap energy. • Fast electron-hole (e−/h+) pair recombination rate. • Agglomeration of nanoparticles. • Difficult in separation of catalyst after photocatalysis from aqueous solution. • Reusability. The nanocarbon-based semiconductor materials are gaining the attention of researchers to overcome the aforementioned problems related to the pure metal semiconductors. Carbon-based aerogels showed good results not only in terms of high visible light photocatalytic activity but also led to the reduction in the band gap energy, slower e−/h+ pair recombination rate, and hence better recovery and reusability of the catalyst. Due to the unique properties of 1D CNTs and 2D GN, such as physicochemical, electrical, and optical properties, the semiconductor aerogel composite photocatalysts have been widely synthesized and applied for the degradation/reduction of the various types of pollutants [34, 80]. GN and metal-based composite aerogels have been synthesized successfully by the self-assembly of GO nanosheets with π–π staking and the H-bonding between sheets, and then applied as the photocatalysts. Nawaz and coworkers [81] synthesized the 3D aerogel of rGO/TiO2 and its application was investigated for the photocatalytic degradation of carbamazepine in an aqueous solution. The composite aerogels not only showed higher adsorption but also showed two times higher photocatalytic properties than the pure TiO2. The rGO helped in the charge separations by acting as an electron sink and the amounts of the rGO and TiO2 in the rGO/TiO2 aerogel played a vital role in the improvement of the photocatalytic activity. Wang et al. [82] suggested that the excessive concentration of the rGO in the composite may promote the recombination of the photogenerated e−/h+ pair by acting as a kind of e−/h+ pair recombination center. Thus, excessive amounts may show a negative impact on the adsorption and photocatalysis. In agreement with this, Nawaz et al. [81] also reported that rGO/TiO2 aerogel prepared in the ratio 1:2 (rGO:TiO2) showed the best degradation efficiency and reusability over the five successive cycles. A proposed mechanism for the degradation of carbamazepine is shown in Fig. 1.6 . A novel 3D AgBr/GN aerogel photocatalyst was synthesized by uniform distribution of the AgBr nanoparticles throughout the porous structure of GN aerogel. [83]. Compared to the pristine AgBr, the photocatalytic degradation efficiency and reusability of the AgBr/GN aerogels was much higher, not only for the oxidative degradation of methyl orange but also towards the reduction of Cr(VI) to Cr(III). The authors reported three possible reasons for the higher photocatalytic activity of the AgBr/GN aerogels compared to the pure AgBr: (i) High adsorption capacity due to large BET surface area. (ii) Strong interaction between the AgBr and GN aerogels, which reduces the recombination of the e−/h+ pair and enhances photocatalytic activity. (iii) High stability of the AgBr/GN aerogels. Besides the GN aerogels, CNTs and carbon aerogel have also been explored for wastewater decontamination. Carbon aerogels show high adsorption due to high surface area and good conductivity that favors the charge separation between the semiconductor and carbon aerogel. Wang et al. [84] prepared a ternary composite aerogel of Cu2O/TiO2/carbon aerogel for the degradation of 2,4,6-trichlorophenol. The degradation efficiency of 2,4,6-trichlorophenol and total organic carbon removal were 96.3 and 91.3%, respectively, in 5.5h on a prepared Cu2O/TiO2/carbon aerogel. A proposed mechanism for the electrosorption-assisted visible light photocatalytic degradation of 2,4,6-trichlorophenol is shown in Fig. 1.7 . The high surface area and the large electron storage capability of the single-walled CNTs are considered the ideal support materials for the synthesis of the novel photocatalyst. Park et al. [85] synthesized TiO2 decorated on the single-walled CNTs (Fig. 1.8 ) and investigated the degradation of methylene blue under visible light irradiation. After incorporation of TiO2 onto the single-walled CNT surface, a significant reduction in band gap energy from 3.2 (TiO2) to 2.6eV was observed. The authors reported that the degradation rate of TiO2/single-walled CNT aerogels was approximately twice that of the reported TiO2/CNT composites. 1.6 Nanocarbon aerogels as sensors Previously, it has been discussed that aerogels are extremely low density materials with a very high surface area. Various forms of aerogels (carbon, silicon, metal oxides, organic polymers, etc.) have been produced for practical application due to these interesting properties. Carbon quantum dots have also gained attention due to their peculiar properties such as low toxicity and environmentally friendly nature in comparison to the heavy metal quantum dots, along with good electrochemical properties, photoluminescence, unique opticals, etc. [26, 86]. The importance of nitrogen dioxide (NO2) detection is due to its harmful effects to the respiratory systems of humans and animals. NO2 is a typical model pollutant for sensing materials and is one of the most prominent air pollutants as well as a source of particulate matter in the atmosphere, for example, PM2.5, acid rain, and photochemical smog. Besides NO x , volatile organic compound exposure to humans is also very harmful and causes various respiratory diseases [87, 88]. Therefore, in order to monitor air quality and as a precautionary warning, volatile organic compound sensors are much needed. The typical designs of different gas sensors are mainly based on adsorption of analytes and their detection on the surface of the sensor. With the sensing of analytes being a surface phenomenon, the surface area of the sensor therefore plays an important role in sensor design. With aerogels being extremely low density solids with a very high surface area, they have good potential to be utilized in chemical or vapor sensors [67, 89]. Wang et al. constructed an NO2 gas sensor based on carbon quantum dots-aerogel hybrid materials. The group functionalized silica aerogel with branched polyethylenimine-capped quantum dots and observed its fluorescence quantum yield more than 40%. The prepared hybrid aerogel (porous quantum-aerogel) exhibited excellent fluorescence activity in the solid state. The fluorescence activity of the hybrid aerogel was quenched selectively and sensitively by the NO2 gas, and therefore offers its potential for a gas-sensing application [26]. While Dolai et al. [90] have reported sensor based on fluorescent carbon quantum dots embedded in silica aerogel for sensing different volatile organic compounds. The carbon quantum dots show a highly sensitive (to local environments), broad-ranged, excitation-dependent emission spectra and offer possible sensing applications [91, 92]. They also found a distinct shifting and quenching phenomenon in the fluorescence signals of the carbon quantum dot aerogel. Thubsuang et al. [93] reported a highly sensitive vapor sensor based on carbon aerogel derived from polybenzoxazine. The aerogel of activated carbon is a nanoporous material with high pore volume (57cm3/g) and surface area (~920m2/g). The activated carbon aerogel/polybutadiene composite exhibited a good response of 11.2 and 6.7 towards toluene and n-hexane, respectively. The aerogel also exhibited good recovery as the electrical resistance came back to the original value within minutes when exposed to nitrogen gas. GN and GN-based materials hold technological promise in the areas of energy storage, electronics, composites, actuators, and sensors. Individual GN sheets possess a number of remarkable properties, including extremely low electrical and thermal resistivity, large carrier mobility, high surface area, and exceptional mechanical elasticity [94–96]. GN-based sensors have also been made on the basis of changes in their properties such as electrical conductance, etc. Samsonau et al. [97] fabricated a sensor based on GN film (1.5nm) for the detection of NO2. The film's thickness displayed high chemical sensitivity towards NO2 to tens of parts per billion. The sensitivity is attributed to the sufficient concentration of a hole-like carrier through the electron transfer from a p-type electron withdrawing GN to NO2 acceptors adsorbed on GN [98, 99]. Yavari et al. [100] studied the sensing characteristics of NO2 and NH3 in mechanically robust and porous GN foams having interconnected network. NO2 adsorption caused an increase in conductance while NH3 adsorption reduced conductance during the detection process, arising from a decrease in the number of charge carriers on GN. The GN foam-based sensor exhibited much better sensitivity than commercial polymer sensors [101], which is due to the effective transport of the charge carrier between the high porosity foam, few-layer GN component, and the adsorbed gas. Xu et al. [102] reported very good catalytic performance of a GN-based sensor for NO reduction. They used a film of GN/Au composite immobilized with hemoglobin as a sensor that responded sensitively for NO with a detection limit of 1.2×10−8 molL−1. Guo et al. [103] designed a very stable biomimetic sensor by using pyrenebutyric acid functionalized GN film. It was observed to exhibit excellent sensitivity toward nitric oxide to be utilized for real-time nitric oxide detection, which is released from living cells [104]. Alizadeh and Ahmadian [105] reported an ammonia sensor based on a GN aerogel treated with thiourea. On exposure to ammonia, the sensor exhibited a change in the electrical conductivity, which was the basis of the sensing mechanism. They hydrothermally prepared GN hydrogel and heated it in the presence of thiourea to obtain the GN aerogel. The aerogels so prepared exhibited a higher surface area (389m2 g−1), better selectivity, higher sensitivity, and a shorter response time. The response of the sensor was found to be linear towards ammonia in the range of 0.02–85ppm and a detection limit up to 10 parts per billion was obtained. Preparation conditions (amount of thiourea) were also found to affect the sensing properties of the resultant aerogel. Jeong et al. [106] prepared a 3D aerogel consisting of molybdenum disulphide (MoS2) and a GN-based glucose electrochemical biosensor. The 3D MoS2/GN aerogel provided a larger surface area that effectively assists the enzyme immobilization, and additionally provides an electrically conductive and continuous framework of GN sheets. The electrode made of this aerogel exhibited a low detection limit and rapid response for glucose sensing. Liu et al. [107] synthesized 3D GN aerogel/ZnO composite-based NO2 sensors that exhibited good response and fast and effective response/recovery behavior, even at room temperature. The homogeneously anchored ZnO spheres on the GN surface and the 3D GN offered interconnected macroporous networks, which was attributed to the enhancement of the sensing response of the sensor. Li et al. [108] developed a two-step strategy to hydrothermally prepare 3D SnO2/rGO composites and use them for NO2 detection. It was found that the products prepared from different tin salts exhibited different sensing performances for NO2 detection. GN-based aerogels generally are weak and delicate; therefore, it is difficult to utilize them as flexible sensors for strain. It is also noticed that the π–π stacking and the van der Waals forces between two different GN sheets cause brittleness in the structure of the aerogel. To improve the mechanical properties of such aerogels, Yuan et al [109] prepared GN/alginate aerogels that possessed excellent porosity (~99.61%) and very low density (6–7mg/cm−3). These aerogels also exhibited excellent durability, excellent bending, and compression sensitivity. These properties of the aerogels are attributed to the presence of a strong hydrogen bonding between the GN and sodium alginate. An et al. [110] fabricated a GN aerogel having a 3D nanostructure using a microextrusion printing technique for electronic sensor devices. Multiresponse, multifunction, and high integration are the critical pursuits of advanced electronic wearable sensors. The printed GN aerogel patterns exhibited excellent electrical conductivity while the 3D nanostructure of aerogel offered multidimensional deformation-sensing responses that are suitable for the wearable flexible electric sensor. These may also be utilized for complicated movement sensing. Therefore, these printed aerogel sensors offer promising applications in gesture language analysis and auxiliary devices for deaf-mute communication. Qi et al. [111] reported the first aerogel as a vapor sensor based on CNTs and cellulose. The sensing characteristics of the aerogels for vapors were observed as a change in the electrical conductivity upon exposure to volatile organic compounds such as ethanol, methanol, toluene, etc. These aerogels exhibited high sensitivity, rapid response, and good reproducibility towards different vapors. The sensing property of these aerogels is enhanced due to their 3D and porous structure, which in turn provide a surface for the analyte to be detected. Li et al. [112] prepared a 3D chitosan/CNTs aerogel with the wide tips of CNTs emerging on the surface of chitosan/CNTs aerogel nanosheets by the ice-templating method. The unique design of the aerogel was utilized for biosensing applications, which exhibited good specificity toward dopamine even at an extremely low concentration (0.3nM). The uniqueness of the surface of the nanosheets with wide CNT tips makes it an incubative bed for in situ adsorbed growth of nanostructures. Cu2O/CuO chipped core-shell nanoparticles were in situ grown onto the soft nanosheets by simple adsorption of Cu2+ and used later for nonenzymatic detection. Gao et al. [113] composited a 3D and ultralight aerogel (density 2.52mgcm−3) containing GN and poly(dopamine) modified CNTs. These aerogels exhibited excellent electrical conductivity, repeatable compressibility, and offered promising applications in strain-sensitive functional devices. 1.7 Conclusion and future research This chapter summarizes the major developments in the nanocarbon aerogels comprising GN, CNT, ND, and their composites, with an emphasis on fabrication techniques and properties as well as their potential applications in energy and environmental remediation sectors. The aerogel composites containing GN, CNT, ND, and polymers/metal/metal oxides exhibit remarkable strength and porosity, which might open new applications in the field of environmental remediation, energy storage, nanotechnology, electronics, medicine, etc. However, much attention needs to be paid to the synthesis mechanism for their cost-effective production and to understand the different parameters which needs to be conditioned for their application in the various discussed fields. With the deepening energy crisis, there is a pressing need to develop advanced and upgraded capacitors (super/pseudo) by minimizing the defects caused by disordered porosity and therefore, newer fabrication methods for enhancing the electronic transport in the nanocarbon-based aerogels is an important area of research. These nanocarbon-based aerogels should be further studied and their photocatalytic performances should be improved to efficiently degrade more toxic and harmful compounds in the environment. The nanocarbon aerogels showed excellent properties for the removal of water contaminants and could be used for commercial applications. However, enough work has been done to probe the water purification application of the carbon aerogels, so more research work should be focused on the following areas: (i) Production of low-cost, carbon-based aerogels for commercial use with low adverse effect on environment during synthesis. (ii) The mechanism of wastewater purification by carbon aerogels should be explored in detail. (iii) Most work has been focused on synthetic wastewater. Therefore more research should be focused on investigating the application of the aerogels on real wastewater to optimize the operational parameters. (iv) The application of the carbon aerogels should be tested on a pilot scale and by column process. (v) Green synthesis of aerogels with high stability, efficiency, and good reusability using environmentally friendly techniques. (vi) Simple routes for mechanically robust aerogels which can resist shrinking upon repeated usage. References [1] N. Bheekhun A. Talib A. Rahim M.R.
