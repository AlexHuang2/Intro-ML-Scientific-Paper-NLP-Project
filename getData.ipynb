Abstract To identify potentially unfair use of international aviation carbon emission rights in different countries, this paper presents a carbon Lorenz curve and Gini coefficient, constructed on the basis of historical cumulative international aviation CO2 emissions per capita. The study follows a methodology adapted from the research into fair income allocation. The results of these calculations show that there has been vast unfairness surrounding international aviation carbon emissions in the past, and that this unfairness has been partially hidden by a delay in accumulative start dates. A solution to this problem, allowing fair allocation of carbon emissions, is the key to building a mechanism for the reduction of global international aviation emissions. This study proposes a fair method for allocating emission rights, based on a responsibility-capacity index. Taking a goal of carbon-neutral growth by 2020 as an example, the degree of carbon emission reduction expected from different countries by 2021 is calculated using the proposed method. Keywords Aviation carbon emission rights Fair allocation Carbon Lorenz curve Carbon Gini coefficient Responsibility-capacity index 1 Introduction Carbon emissions from the aviation industry currently account for 2.0%â2.5% of global yearly anthropogenic carbon emissions. Following the rising demand and rapid growth in the aviation industry, emissions from this sector have increased by 98% from 1990 to 2006, and are expected to account for 10% of global greenhouse gas emissions caused by human activities by 2050 unless measures are taken (ICAO, 2010). As a major source of upper-air greenhouse gases, the aviation industry is faced with enormous pressure to reduce emissions. However, the aviation industries of different countries are currently at different stages of their development cycles, and the total international aviation carbon emissions differ considerably from the carbon emissions per capita in different countries. These differences may be solidified by unfair allocation schemes, which can lead to market distortion in the development of national aviation industries. Therefore, with the rights of aviation carbon emissions becoming increasingly limited, it is now imperative that a method is developed to measure and evaluate the fairness of the allocation of international aviation emission rights and thereby distribute aviation carbon emission rights in a fair and reasonable way. The issue of fairness of carbon emission rights among different countries has been strongly debated since at least 1992, when the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change treaty was signed. Over the past hundred years, developed countries have typically generated a large number of carbon emissions as a result of industrialization, while developing countries have historically generated fewer emissions, although this is expected to increase in response to future industrial development. Therefore, the intentionally fair principle of common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities was proposed as part of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, signed in 1992 and the Kyoto Protocol, signed in 1997. However, due to differences in interests and interpretations by different countries, agreement on the specific meaning and applicability of this fairness has yet to be reached by the international community. In current international aviation market-based mechanism schemes, including both the existing European Union Greenhouse Gas Emission Trading Scheme or the preliminary market-based mechanism scheme of the International Civil Aviation Organization, the allocation of carbon emission rights is mainly dominated by developed countries, and the fair allocation of the responsibilities and obligations of aviation emission rights for all countries remains a major focus of debate. Thus, research into the fairness of international aviation carbon emission rights allocations is crucial. 2 The principle of fair international aviation carbon emission rights allocation The principle of fair international aviation carbon emission rights incorporates different aspects, including justice, equality, and equity. The principle involves two major types of fairness, intra-generational fairness and inter-generation fairness (Chen, 2012; Zheng and Liang, 2011; Lu, 2013; Pan and Zheng, 2009). Intra-generational fairness refers to equal rights in the demand for a good living environment and the use of natural resources among people of the same generation, regardless of any differences in nationality, race, gender, level of economic development, and culture (Zheng, 2002). Historically and presently, intra-generational unfairness of environmental issues is seen as an extremely serious problem. Through a calculation of the international aviation CO2 emissions per capita, there are huge differences in CO2 emissions of different countries, and especially between developed and developing countries; this leads to intra-generational unfairness. The top 20 countries for CO2 emissions in 2011 are listed in Table 1 , which shows significant differences between the CO2 emissions of different countries. For example, emissions per capita of the United States are seven times those of China, and those of European Union are nine times those of China. Intra-generational fairness is closely related to the level of economic development and should be translated into equal aviation carbon emission rights for all. In contrast, inter-generational fairness refers to equal rights in the use of natural resources, enjoying a clean environment, and ensuring the survival and development of current and future generations. In essence, it is a problem rooted in the inter-generational allocation of natural resources (Wu et al., 2009; GrÃ¼bler and Fujii, 1991). Historical changes in the emission responsibilities of developed countries should be considered when considering inter-generational fairness. Despite the relatively recent development of the international aviation industry, there have always been large gaps in cumulative emissions between different countries, and these differences are even larger between the cumulative emissions per capita. Table 2 shows the top 20 international aviation cumulative CO2 emissions per capita during 1971â2011. The international aviation historical cumulative CO2 emissions per capita of the United States are 16 times those of China, and those of the European Union are approximately 20 times those of China, thus indicating serious inter-generational unfairness in international aviation CO2 emissions. This disparity is closely related to the relative stages of economic and aviation development in different countries. As the economy and aviation industry was established earlier in developed countries, their historical emissions are higher than those in developing countries. In contrast, the historical emissions of developing countries are currently relatively low, but may be expected to grow rapidly in the future. Therefore, the historical emission responsibilities of developed countries and the future growth in demand for emissions for developing countries should be fully considered when allocating aviation emission rights. There are two important principles guiding the fair allocation of carbon emission rights (Ringius et al., 2002; He et al., 2009). First is the principle of culpability, measured by the role the relevant parties play upon causing a problem. Thus, according to the principle of culpability, if a problem is created by the actions of a person, it is a fair practice that the responsibility to solve the problem lies with that person. Second is the principle of payment capability, in which fairness demands that the behavioral subjects take responsibility for undesirable effects according to their different capabilities. In the context of the present study, the principle of culpability requires the responsibility of historical emissions to be taken into account, while the principle of payment capability considers the present national conditions of different countries. Thus, considerations of the fairness of international aviation carbon emission rights allocation must incorporate intra-generational fairness and inter-generational fairness, in addition to the principle of culpability and the principle of payment capability. Intra-generational fairness requires consideration of the fairness of international aviation emissions per capita, while inter-generational fairness includes the fairness of historical international aviation emissions. The principle of culpability requires consideration of historical responsibility, while the principle of payment capability considers the developmental levels of different countriesâ economies and aviation industries, and in particular the aviation emission rights of developing countries. 3 Measurement of the historical fairness of international aviation carbon emissions rights The Gini coefficient was defined by Italian economist Corrado Gini in the early 20th century as an index to judge the fairness of income allocation according to a Lorenz curve (Liu and Chen, 2008; Wang et al., 2011; Liu et al., 2004). In essence, the Gini coefficient represents a quantitative analysis of allocation uniformity. Therefore, in addition to being used for analyzing the fairness of social wealth allocation in economics, the Gini coefficient can be used for any allocation uniformity analysis in other subjects. For example, Wu et al. (2006) used the Gini coefficient in a study allocating the total amount of water pollutants, Teng et al. (2010) used it when measuring carbon equity, while Heil and Wodon (2000) applied it to the measurement of inequality in CO2 emissions. Using the Gini coefficient to quantify fairness, this paper seeks to assess the fair allocation of international aviation carbon emission rights. We use historical international aviation cumulative CO2 emissions per capita as an index to construct the carbon Gini coefficient of international aviation CO2 emissions, and to measure the fairness of possession and use of international aviation carbon emission rights in the past. The carbon Lorenz curve (Fig. 1 ) is first constructed using historical international aviation cumulative CO2 emissions per capita data (shown in Table 2), which directly illustrates the unfairness of possession and use of limited international aviation carbon emission rights by different countries over time. In Fig. 1, countries are listed in ascending order of cumulative emissions per capita. The abscissa represents the accumulative percentage of population in 2011. The ordinate represents the accumulative percentage of international aviation CO2 accumulative emissions from 1971 to 2011. On the basis of the Lorenz curve, this paper uses an area-based calculation method to calculate the Gini coefficient of international aviation CO2 emissions. Setting the area between the actual allocation curve and the absolute fair allocation curve as X, and the area below the actual allocation curve as Y, the Gini coefficient (G) is equal to X/(X+Y), and thus the calculation formula is: (1) G = X X + Y = 0.5 â Y 0.5 = 1 â 2 Y . Supposing there are a total of n countries, then Y can be divided into n trapezoids. The sum of the areas of all those trapezoids is approximately the area of Y, (2) Y = â j = 1 n ( C j â 1 + C j ) ( P j â P j â 1 ) 2 = 1 2 â j = 1 n ( C j â 1 + C j ) Î P j , where P j and C j are the abscissa and the ordinate of country j, respectively, and ÎP j is the percentage of the population of country j. In this way, Y calculated from this formula will be very close to the true value when n is very large. Generally, a Gini coefficient of 0.4 is used internationally as a warning line of an allocation gap. The calculation result in this case shows that there is a wide gap in allocation, as the Gini coefficient of international aviation CO2 emissions is 0.68, which is far beyond the warning line. This result also indicates that 68% of the international aviation carbon emission rights were distributed unfairly in the past, and that the majority were overrepresented by developed countries. The choice of starting year is a crucial decision in the measurement of the fairness of international aviation CO2 emissions. Most studies (Yang, 2010; Halverson, 2007) have shown that the earlier the starting year, the greater the degree of unfairness. However, there have been no quantitative studies about the impact of different starting years on changing historical responsibilities. This paper attempts to use the carbon Lorenz curve and Gini coefficient of international aviation emissions to analyze the impact of choosing different starting years on the calculation of historical responsibilities. Using 1990 and 2005 as starting years, the Gini coefficients of international aviation CO2 emissions are found to be 0.63 and 0.60 respectively. With a delay in the accumulative starting year, the value of the carbon Gini coefficient reduces, and the historical unfairness of international aviation CO2 emissions of different countries may be hidden. 4 A fair allocation scheme for international aviation CO2 emission rights Considering the aspects and principles of fairness, and using the allocation method for greenhouse gas rights proposed by Baer et al. (2008) for reference, this paper presents a novel fair method of allocating international aviation CO2 emission rights. 4.1 Model building As discussed above, a fair allocation scheme should consider both historical emission responsibilities and current capacities for emission reduction. Considering these elements, a responsibility-capacity index is designed, in which the respective responsibility and capacity of different countries can be reflected. (3) I = R a Ã C b ( 0 â¤ a , b â¤ 1 ) , where R is the historical responsibility of international aviation emissions; C represents the emission reduction capacity. a and b are the weights of R and C, respectively, which contributes to I and varies with different values. In reality, their values are determined by negotiation between all parties. When a = b, responsibility and capacity have equal weight. The index of historical international aviation cumulative CO2 emissions per capita can reflect the historical responsibility of different countries, and Table 2 shows that developed countries have higher historical cumulative CO2 emissions per capita, indicating that developed countries have greater historical responsibilities. In comparison, the emission reduction capacity of a country has a close relationship with its economic, scientific and technological developmental stage, and GDP per capita can be used as an indicator to largely reflect this stage (ICAO, 2013). Thus, this paper uses historical international aviation cumulative CO2 emissions per capita and GDP per capita as the two parameters R and C, when calculating I. 4.2 Allocation method for international aviation CO2 emission rights First, an emission reduction target should be set, which will guide the control of international aviation CO2 emission rights (ÎE). To achieve the international aviation emission objective, taking the goal of carbon-neutral growth by 2020, meaning that international aviation will maintain a constant, zero net growth from 2020, as an example, each country must take measures to reduce international aviation CO2 emissions. Second, the responsibility-capacity index for each country should be calculated. As the emission reduction obligation is to be set for the year following the current year, GDP, population, and international aviation CO2 emission data are as yet unavailable, therefore the two parameters needed for calculating the responsibility-capacity index will be set by data from the year before the allocating year. This is designed so that a time difference will have minimal impact on allocation results. The following represents the calculating formula for country j in allocating year t. (4) I j = ( â i = t 0 t â 1 E j , i P j , t â 1 ) a ( G D P j , t â 1 P j , t â 1 ) b , where t 0 is the starting year of the accumulative calculation, tâ1 is the year before the allocating year t, E j,i represents the international aviation emissions of country j in year i, and P j,tâ1 and GDP j,tâ1 are the population and GDP of country j in year tâ1 respectively. The calculation of responsibility-capacity index is a dynamic process, allowing the historical emission responsibility and the future emission reduction capacity to be fully taken into consideration. Finally, the amount of emission reduction expected for different countries can be calculated. The emission reduction quantity of country j in allocating year t is calculated by relative proportion of each country. The formula is as follows: (5) Î E j = I j â I P j , t â 1 â ( I j â I P j , t â 1 ) Î E = I j P j , t â 1 â ( I j P j , t â 1 ï¼ Î E . 4.3 Example application of the allocation method As an example, this paper employs the above method to fairly allocate international aviation CO2 emission rights for the year 2021. First, we determine the global emission reduction target and the emission reduction quantity. Supposing that the global emission goal is for carbon-neutral growth by 2020, the emission reduction quantity ÎE is increased in 2021 relative to 2020. According to the forecast, the global international aviation CO2 emissions are currently 620.27 Mt 1 1 In reality these data are already known. This article uses 3.17%, which is the average growth rate of 2001â2011 based on the data of CO2 Emissions from Fuel Combustion (2013 Edition), as the annual growth rate after 2011. , and taking 3.17% as the annual growth rate of global international aviation CO2 emissions. So ÎE = 620.27 Ã 3.17% = 19.66 Mt. Second, we calculate I j for each country. The allocating year is therefore t = 2021, and the GDP and the population in the year 2020 are used as data for GDP j,tâ1 and P j,tâ1 for each country 2 2 The data of population and GDP are forecast based on the average growth rate for 2001â2011. GDP is quoted relative to 2005 exchange rates (billion$ 2005). . Taking the start year t 0 = 1990 as an example, the international aviation emissions of each country are derived from IEA data 3 3 The emissions data for these areas from 2012 to 2020 are forecasts based on the average growth rate during 2001â2011. We suppose that the result of negotiation between all parties provides values of parameters a and b such that a = b = 0.5. Then, I j of the different countries can be calculated using Eq. (4). Further, the amount of international aviation emission reduction ÎE j , for each country, can be calculated by Eq. (5). From these calculations, the allocation results of some major countries are listed in Table 3 . The emission reduction allocated to China is 2.11 Mt CO2, while the predicted total international aviation emissions of China are 82.96 Mt CO2 in 2021; this represents a proportional reduction of 2.3%. Relative to the total global international aviation emission reduction in 2021, the proportion of emission reduction allocated to China is 10.7%, which is less than the proportion of China's international aviation emissions relative to the global emissions in 2021, which is 14.2%. Further, the results shows that the emission reduction allocated to China is less than that allocated based on the actual emission ratio in future years. Considering the amount that emissions will increase in future, the proportion of obligation given to China is comparatively lower. Meanwhile, a 2.11 Mt emission reduction accounts for 2.5% of emissions in 2020, which means that if the growth rate of China's international aviation emissions is reduced by just 2.5%, it will be able to achieve its emission reduction goal. The average annual growth rate of international aviation emissions in China was 9.8% between 2001 and 2011, following the development of international aviation in China; the growth rate after 2021 is predicted to be between 3.2% and 6%, which will be slightly lower than twice the average global growth rate. Supposing that the emission growth rate of China is 6% under unrestricted conditions, then the growth rate of China in 2021 should be controlled such that 6%â2.5% = 3.5%, according to this scheme. Although this still represents a significant pressure on the aviation industry of China, a growth rate of 3.5% can still be maintained, in contrast to most of the major developed countries, which must have a negative emission growth to accomplish their emission reduction objectives. Therefore, in this case the emission reduction responsibility for China is lower than that of the major developed countries. 5 Conclusions and discussions This paper aimed to analyze the fairness of international aviation emission rights allocation, based on aspects of inter-generational and intra-generational fairness, as well as the principles of culpability and payment capability. Using a previously developed approach for analyzing fair income allocation as reference, we constructed a carbon Lorenz curve and Gini coefficient for historical international aviation cumulative CO2 emissions per capita, and used them as criteria for quantifying the unfairly allocation and use of international aviation emission rights in the past. The results show that there has been considerable unfairness in international aviation carbon emissions in the past. For example, taking 1971 as an accumulative starting year, approximately 68% of international aviation emission rights are unfairly allocated. The carbon Gini coefficient indicates that the unfairness is partially hidden by a delay in the accumulative start date. Furthermore, we constructed a responsibility-capacity index based on the historical international aviation cumulative CO2 emissions per capita and GDP per capita, and proposed a method of allocating international aviation emission rights. Taking the goal of carbon-neutral growth by 2020 as an example, we used the proposed method to calculate the amount of carbon emission reduction necessary from different countries in 2021. A worked example showed that the emission reduction allocated to China is 2.11 Mt in 2021, accounting for 10.7% of the global emission reduction in that year, which represents a considerable pressure on the fast growing aviation industry of China. The allocation scheme for international aviation emission rights proposed in this paper only considers the principles of fairness, without considering the specific circumstances and respective capacities of some countries, such as island countries that mainly rely on air transportation to travel to and from between landmasses. Most of these island countries have higher historical cumulative CO2 emissions per capita, and the proposed allocation scheme will undoubtedly increase their transportation costs. In addition, the responsibility-capacity index incorporates only the GDP per capita as an emission reduction capacity indicator, but this does not fully reveal the economic differences between countries. Therefore, due to the fact that emission reduction technologies are mainly available to only a few developed countries, the allocation scheme of international aviation emission rights should consider the specific national demands for air transportation, as well as the differences in emission reduction technology in different countries, and should be amended using relevant correction coefficients. In summary, the allocation of international aviation emission reduction obligations is a complicated and difficult task, and further and more in-depth research into fairness, rationality, and feasibility is needed.

This flaw allows an attacker to impersonate Kerberos administrative principals (KDC) and end- servers to a client, hence breaching the authentication guarantees of Kerberos. It also gives the attacker the keys that the KDC would normally generate to encrypt the service requests of this client, hence defeating confidentiality as well. The discovery of this attack caused the IETF to change the specification of PKINIT and Microsoft to release a security update for some Windows operating systems. We discovered this attack as part of an ongoing formal analysis of the Kerberos protocol suite, and we have formally verified several possible fixes to PKINITâincluding the one adopted by the IETFâthat prevent our attack as well as other authentication and secrecy properties of Kerberos with PKINIT.

Introduction Kerberos [1] is a successful, widely deployed single sign-on protocol that is designed to authenticate clients to multiple networked services, e.g., remote hosts, file servers, or print spoolers. Kerberos 5, the most recent version, is available for all major operating systems: Microsoft has included it in its Windows operating system, it is H32891 Cervesato was partially supported by the Qatar Foundation under grant number 930107, with early aspects of this work supported by ONR under grants N00014-99-1-0150 and N00014-01-1-0795.

Cervesato et al. / Information and Computation 206 (2008) 402â424 403 available for Linux under the name Heimdal, and commercial Unix variants as well as Appleâs OS X use code from the MIT implementation of Kerberos 5. Furthermore, it is being used as a building block for higher-level protocols [2]. Introduced in the early 1990s [3], Kerberos 5 continues to evolve as new functionalities are added to the basic protocol. One of these extensions, known as PKINIT, modifies the basic protocol to allow public-key authentication and in the process adds considerable complexity to the protocol. Here we report a protocol-level attack on PKINIT and discuss the constructive process of fixing it. We have verified a few defenses against our attack, including one we suggested, a different one proposed in the IETF Kerberos working group (and included the final PKINIT specification), and a generalization of these two approaches. A Kerberos session generally starts with a user logging onto a system. This triggers the creation of a client process that will transparently handle all her authentication requests. The initial authentication between the client and the Kerberos administrative principals (altogether known as the KDC, for Key Distribution Center) is traditionally based on a shared key derived from a password chosen by the user. PKINIT is intended to add flexibility, security and administrative convenience by replacing this static shared secret with two pairs of public/private keys, one assigned to the KDC and one belonging to the user. PKINIT is supported by Kerberized versions of Microsoft Windows, typically for use with smartcard authentication, including Windows 2000 Professional and Server, Windows XP, Windows Server 2003 and now Windows Vista [4]; it has also been included in Heimdal since 2002 [5]. The MIT reference implementation is being extended with PKINIT. The flaw we have uncovered in PKINIT allows an attacker to impersonate the KDC, and therefore all the Kerberized services, to a user, hence defeating authentication of the server to the client. The attacker also obtains all the keys that the KDC would normally generate for the client to encrypt her service requests, hence compromising confidentiality as well. This is a protocol-level attack and was a flaw in the then-current specification, not just a particular implementation. In contrast to recently reported attacks on Kerberos 4 [6], our attack does not use an oracle, but is efficiently mounted in constant time by simply decrypting a message with one key, changing one important value, and re-encrypting it with the victimâs public key. The consequences of this attack are quite serious. For example, the attacker could monitor communication between an honest client and a Kerberized network file server. This would allow the attacker to read the files that the client believes are being securely transferred to the file server. Our attack is possible because the two messages constituting PKINIT were insufficiently bound to each other. 1 More precisely, the reply (the second message of this exchange) can easily be modified so that it appears to correspond to a request (the first message) sent by a client different from the one the reply is generated for. Assumptions required for this attack are that the attacker is a legal user, that he can intercept other clientsâ requests, and that PKINIT is used in âpublic-key encryption modeâ. The alternative âDiffieâHellman (DH) modeâ does not appear vulnerable to this attack; we are in the process of proving its full security. We discovered this attack as part of an ongoing formal analysis of the Kerberos 5 protocol suite. Our earlier work on Kerberos successfully employed formal methods for the verification of the authentication properties of basic intra-realm Kerberos 5 [7,8] and of cross-realm authentication [8,9]. Although our work is carried out by hand, a variety of automated approaches exist for symbolic proofs [10â17] and have also been applied to deployed protocols (e.g., [18â20]). In a recent collaboration with M. Backes, we have started extending our results from the abstract DolevâYao model examined here to the more concrete computational model [21]. Interestingly, the results described in more detail here served as a blueprint for the much more fine-grained proofs in [21]. Furthermore, we have started exploring automated security proofs of Kerberos [22] using the tool CryptoVerif [23,24], which works directly within the computational model. After discovering the attack on PKINIT, we worked in close collaboration with the IETF Kerberos Working Group, in particular with the authors of the PKINIT specification documents, to correct the problem. Our contribution in this regard has been a formal analysis of a general countermeasure to this attack, as well as the particular instance proposed by the Working Group that has been adopted in the PKINIT specification [25]. Our attack led to an August 2005 Microsoft Security Bulletin and patch [4]. It was also recorded as a CERT advisory [26]. This paper extends our preliminary report [27] with additional authentication properties, full proofs of our results, and a more complete discussion of our techniques, formalization, and the protocol itself. 1 The possibility of an âidentity misbindingâ attack was independently hypothesized by Ran Canetti, whom we consulted on some details of the specification. 404 I. Cervesato et al. / Information and Computation 206 (2008) 402â424 Fig. 1. An Overview of Kerberos Authentication. Below, in Section 2 we recall the structure of Kerberos and give a detailed description of PKINIT. In Section 3 we provide an account of the attack we uncovered and outline its consequences. In Section 4 we discuss various approaches to prevent the attack, including the one adopted by the IETF Kerberos working group in response to our work. In Section 5 we review our representation language, MSR, and use it to formalize the fixed version of PKINIT; we give some of our formal resultsâthat the fixed version does prevent our attack and that both the broken and fixed versions have other authentication and secrecy propertiesâin Section 6. Section 7 provides some concluding remarks. 2. Kerberos 5 and its public-key extension The Kerberos protocol [1] allows a legitimate user to log on to her terminal once a day (typically) and then transparently access all the networked resources she needs in her organization for the rest of that day. Each time she wants to retrieve a file from a remote server, for example, Kerberos securely handles the required authentication behind the scene, without any user intervention. We now review how Kerberos provides secure authentication based on a single logon. As we do this, we will be particularly interested in the initial exchange, which happens when the user first logs onto the system. Figure 1 gives an overview of the message flow for the entire Kerberos protocol; Fig. 4 below refines this to show some of the message details for the basic protocol. We start this section with a detailed review of the first exchange in the protocol, both with and without PKINIT. 2.1. Kerberos basics The client processâusually acting on behalf of a human userâinteracts with three other types of principals during the three rounds of Kerberos 5 (with or without PKINIT). The clientâs goal is to be able to authen- ticate herself to various application servers (e.g., email, file, and print servers). This is done by first obtaining credentials, called the âticket-granting ticketâ (TGT), from a âKerberos Authentication Serverâ (KAS) and then by presenting these credentials to a âTicket-Granting Serverâ (TGS) in order to obtain a âservice ticketâ (ST), which is the credentials that the client finally presents to the application servers in order to authenticate herself (see Fig. 1). A TGT might be valid for a day, and may be used to obtain several STs for many different application servers from the TGS, while a single ST might be valid for a few minutes (although it, too, may be used repeatedly while it is still valid) and is used for a single application server. The KAS and the TGS are altogether known as the âKey Distribution Centerâ (KDC). The clientâs interactions with the KAS, TGS, and application servers are called the Authentication Service (AS), Ticket-Granting (TG), and Client-Server (CS) exchanges, respectively. The focus of this work will be the AS exchange, as PKINIT does not alter the remaining parts of Kerberos. I. Cervesato et al. / Information and Computation 206 (2008) 402â424 405 Fig. 2. Message Flow in the Traditional AS Exchange whereTGT ={AK,C,t K } k T . The traditional authentication service exchange. The abstract structure of the messages in the traditional (non- PKINIT) AS exchange is given in Fig. 2. A clientCgenerates a fresh noncen 1 and sends it, together with her own name and the nameT of the TGS for whom she desires a TGT, to the KAS. The KAS responds by generating a fresh keyAK for use between the client and the TGS. This key is sent back to the client, along with the nonce (n 1 ) from the request, at timestamp (t K ) and other data, encrypted under a long-term keyk C shared betweenC and the KAS; this long-term key is usually derived from the userâs password. We write {m} k for the encryption of m with symmetric key k. This is the only time that this long-term key is used in a standard Kerberos run because later exchanges use freshly generated keys. AK is also included in the TGT, sent alongside the message encrypted for the client. The TGT is encrypted under a long-term keyk T shared between the KAS and the TGS named in the request. These encrypted messages are accompanied by the clientâs nameâand other data that we abstract awayâsent in the clear. Once the client has received this reply, she may undertake the ticket-granting exchange. It should be noted that the actual AS exchange, as well as the other exchanges in Kerberos, are more complex than the abstract view given here; the details we omit here do not affect our results and including them would only obscure their exposition. We refer the reader to [1] for the complete specification of Kerberos 5, and to [7] for a formalization at an intermediate level of detail. Security considerations. One weakness of the standard Kerberos protocol is that the keyk C used to encrypt the clientâs credentials is derived from a password, and passwords are notoriously vulnerable to dictionary attacks [1]. Moreover, since the initial request is entirely plaintext, an active attacker can repeatedly make requests for an honest clientâs credentials and amass a large quantity of plaintext-ciphertext pairs, the latter component being encrypted with the clientâs long-term keyk C . While the attacker is unable to use these credentials to authenticate to the system, he is given considerable opportunity to perform an active dictionary attack against the key. Kerberos can optionally use pre-authentication, a feature that is designed to prevent an attacker from actively requesting and obtaining credentials for an honest user. In brief, pre-authentication works by requiring the client to include a timestamp encrypted with her long-term key (k C ) in the initial request. The authentication server will only return credentials if the decrypted timestamp is sufficiently recent. This method successfully prevents an attacker from actively obtaining ciphertext encrypted with the long-term key; however, it does not prevent passive dictionary attacks, i.e., a passive attacker could eavesdrop on network communications, record credentials as the honest client requests them, and attempt off-line dictionary decryption. Thus, pre- authentication makes it slower for an attacker to perform cryptanalysis against the userâs long-term key, but it does not fully prevent the vulnerability. One goal of PKINIT is to eliminate the possibility of this dictionary attack. 2.2. Public-key Kerberos PKINIT [25] is an extension to Kerberos 5 that uses public-key cryptography to avoid shared secrets between aclientandKAS;itmodifiestheASexchangebutnototherpartsofthebasicKerberos5protocol.Aswejustsaw, the long-term shared key (k C ) in the traditional AS exchange is typically derived from a password, which limits the strength of the authentication to the userâs ability to choose and remember good passwords; PKINIT does not usek C and thus avoids this problem. Furthermore, PKINIT allows network administrators to use an existing public-key infrastructure (PKI) rather than expend additional effort to manage usersâ long-term keys needed for traditional Kerberos. This protocol extension adds complexity to Kerberos as it retains symmetric encryption in the later rounds but relies on asymmetric encryption, digital signatures, and corresponding certificates in the first round. 406 I. Cervesato et al. / Information and Computation 206 (2008) 402â424 Fig. 3. Message Flow in PKINIT-26 , whereTGT ={AK,C,t K } k T . In PKINIT, the clientC and the KAS possess independent public/secret key pairs,(pk C ,sk C )and(pk K ,sk K ), respectively. Certificate setsCert C andCert K issued by a PKI independent from Kerberos are used to testify of the binding between each principal and her purported public key. This simplifies administration as authentication decisions can now be made based on the trust the KDC holds in just a few known certification authorities within the PKI, rather than keys individually shared with each client (local policies can, however, still be installed for user-by-user authentication). Dictionary attacks are defeated as user-chosen passwords are replaced with automaticallygeneratedasymmetrickeys.Theloginprocesschangesasveryfewuserswouldbeabletoremember a random public/secret key pair. In Microsoft Windows, keys and certificate chains are stored in a smartcard that the user swipes in a reader at login time. A passphrase is generally required as an additional security measure [28]. Other possibilities include keeping these credentials on the userâs hard drive, again protected by a passphrase. The manner in which PKINIT works depends on both the protocol version and the mode invoked. As the PKINIT extension to Kerberos has recently been published as RFC 4556 after a sequence of Internet Drafts [25], we use âPKINIT-nâ to refer to the protocol as specified in thenth draft revision and âPKINITâ for the protocol more generally. These various drafts and the RFC can be found at [25]. We discovered the attack described in Section 3 when studying PKINIT-25; our description of the vulnerable protocol is based on PKINIT-26, which does not differ from PKINIT-25 in ways that affect the attack. In response to our work described here, PKINIT-27 included a defense against our attack; we discuss this fix in Section 4. The version of the protocol defined in RFC 4556 does not differ from the parts of PKINIT-27 that we discuss here. PKINIT can operate in two modes. In public-key encryption mode, the key pairs(pk C ,sk C )and(pk K ,sk K )are used for both signature and encryption. The latter is designed to (indirectly) protect the confidentiality of AK, while the former ensures its integrity. In DiffieâHellman (DH) mode, the key pairs are used to provide digital signature support for an authenticated DiffieâHellman key agreement which is used to protect the fresh key AK shared between the client and KAS. A variant of this mode allows the reuse of previously generated shared secrets. We will not discuss the DH mode in detail as our preliminary investigation did not reveal any flaw in it; we are currently working on a complete analysis of this mode. Furthermore, it appears not to have yet been included in any of the major operating systems. The only support we are aware of is within the PacketCable system [29], developed by CableLabs, a cable television research consortium. Figure 3 illustrates the AS exchange in public-key encryption mode as of PKINIT-26. The differences with respect to the traditional AS exchange (see Fig. 2) have been highlighted using boxes. In discussing this and other descriptions of the protocol, we write [m] sk for the digital signature of message m with secret key sk. (PKINIT realizes digital signatures by concatenating the message and a keyed hash for it, occasionally with other data in between.) In our analysis of PKINIT in Section 6, we make the standard assumption that digital signatures are unforgeable [30]. The encryption ofmwith public keypkis denoted {{m}} pk . As before, we write {m} k for the encryption ofmwith symmetric keyk. The first line of Fig. 3 describes the relevant parts of the request that a client C sends to a KAS K using PKINIT-26. The last part of the messageâC,T,n 1 âis exactly as in basic Kerberos 5, containing the clientâs name, the name of the TGS for which she wants a TGT, and a nonce. The boxed parts added by PKINIT include the clientâs certificatesCert C and her signature (with her secret keysk C ) over a timestampt C and another nonce n 2 . (The nonces and timestamp to the left of this line indicate that these are generated byC specifically for this request, with the box indicating data not included in our abstract formalization of basic Kerberos 5 [7,8].) This effectively implements a form of pre-authentication. The second line in Fig. 3 shows our formalization of Kâs response, which is more complex than in basic Kerberos. The last part of the messageâC,TGT, {AK,n 1 ,t K ,T} k âis very similar toKâs reply in basic Kerberos; I. Cervesato et al. / Information and Computation 206 (2008) 402â424 407 Fig. 4. Message flow in basic Kerberos. the difference (boxed) is that the symmetric key k protecting AK is now freshly generated by K and not a long-term shared key. The ticket-granting-ticket TGT and the message encrypted underk are as in traditional Kerberos. Becausek is freshly generated for the reply, it must be communicated toC before she can learnAK. PKINIT does this by adding the message {{Cert K , [k,n 2 ] sk K }} pk C . This containsKâs certificates and his signature, using his secret keysk K , overk and the noncen 2 fromCâs request; all of this is encrypted underCâs public key pk C . This abstract description leaves out a number of fields which are of no significance with respect to the reported attack or its fix. We invite the interested reader to consult the specifications [25]. Also, recall that PKINIT leaves the subsequent exchanges of Kerberos unchanged. 2.3. Message flow in later exchanges For the sake of completeness, we give a brief overview of the message structure in the remaining rounds of Kerberos; Section 3.3 discusses how the attack on PKINIT can be propagated through these later rounds. Figure 4 updates Fig. 1 to show the details of the messages in basic Kerberos. PKINIT modifies the first two of these messages as illustrated in Fig. 3. The AS exchange (either traditional or with PKINIT) provides the client with an authentication keyAK and a ticket-granting-ticketTGT ={AK,C,t K } k T . In the TG exchange,Cthen requests an ST fromT after generating a new noncen 3 and timestamp; her request includes the TGT (which she cannot read but simply forwards from K), an authenticator {C,t C } AK containing her name and timestamp and encrypted withAK, the name of the serverS for which she wants an ST, and the new nonce. Tâs response has the same structure as Kâs, but now with an ST in place of the TGT and S taking the role ofT in the rest of the message. Finally, in the CS exchange, C authenticates herself to S by sending the ST and an authenticator {C,t prime C } SK containing her name and timestamp, and encrypted under the fresh key SK. S may authenticate himself back toC by encryptingCâs timestamp (but notCâs name, so that the result differs from the authenticator) withSK and returning this message toC. 3. The attack In this section, we report on a dangerous attack against PKINIT in public-key encryption mode. We discov- ered this attack as we were interpreting the specification documents of this protocol [25] in preparation for its 408 I. Cervesato et al. / Information and Computation 206 (2008) 402â424 Fig. 5. Message flow in the man-in-the-middle attack on PKINIT-26, whereTGT ={AK, I,t K } k T . formalization in MSR [9,31,32], the specification language for our analysis. We start with a detailed description of the attackerâs actions in the AS exchange, the key to the attack. We then review the conditions required for the attack and close this section with a discussion of how the attacker may propagate the effects of her AS exchange actions throughout the rest of a protocol run. 3.1. Message flow Figure 5 shows the AS exchange message flow in the attack. The client C sends a request to the KAS K which is intercepted by the attacker I, who constructs his own request message using the parameters fromCâs message. All data signed byC are sent unencryptedâindeed [msg] sk can be understood as an abbreviation for the plaintext msg together with a keyed hash of the messageâso that I may generate his own signatures over data from Câs request. The result is a well-formed request message from I, although constructed using some data originating withC. Iâs changes to the request message are boxed above the top-right arrow of Fig. 5. (We have omitted an unkeyed checksum taken over unencrypted data from these messages; I can regenerate this as needed to produce a valid request.) I forwards the fabricated request to the KASK, who views it as a valid request for credentials if I is himself a legitimate client; there is nothing to indicate that some of the data originated withC.K responds with a reply containing credentials for I (the bottom-right arrow in Fig. 5). The TGT has the form {AK,I,t K } k T ; note that, because it is encrypted with the key k T shared between K and the TGS T, it is opaque to C (and I). Another part of the reply is encrypted using the public key of the client for whom the credentials are generated, in this case I. This allows the attacker to decrypt this part of the message using his private key, learn the key k, and use this to learn the keyAK. An honest client would only use this information to send a request message to the TGST. Instead, I usesCâs public key to re-encrypt the data he decrypted using his private key (having learned pk C , if necessary, fromCert C in the original request), replaces his name withCâs, and forwards the result toC. ToC this message appears to be a valid reply fromK generated in response toCâs initial request (recall thatC cannot read Iâs name inside the TGT). At this point,C believes she has authenticated herself to the KAS and that the credentials she has obtainedâ the keyAK and the accompanying TGTâwere generated for her. However, the KAS has completed the PKINIT exchange with I and has generated AK and the TGT for I. The attacker knows the key AK (as well as k, which is not used other than to encryptAK) and can therefore decrypt any message thatC would protect with it. Protocol-level attacks in the same vein of the vulnerability we uncovered have been reported in the literature for other protocols. In 1992, Diffie, van Oorschot, and Wiener noted that a signature-based variant of the Station- to-Station protocol [33] could be defeated by a man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack which bears similarities to what we observed in the first half of our vulnerability; in 2003 Canetti and Krawczyk [34] observed that the âbasic authenticated DiffieâHellmanâ mode of the Internet Key Exchange protocol (IKE) [35] had this very same vulnerability. In 1996, Lowe [36] found an attack on the NeedhamâSchroeder public-key protocol [37] that manipulates public-key encryption essentially in the same way as what happens in the second half of our attack. Because it alters both signatures and asymmetric encryptions, our attack against PKINIT stems from both [36,33]. In 1995, Clark and Jacob [38] discovered a similar flaw on Hwang and Chenâs corrected SPLICE/AS protocol [39]. I. Cervesato et al. / Information and Computation 206 (2008) 402â424 409 Fig. 6. Message flow in the man-in-the-middle attack on PKINIT-26, after the messages in Fig. 5, when the attacker forwards and observes traffic; hereTGT ={AK,I,t K } k T andST ={SK, I,t T } k S . 3.2. Assumptions In order for this attack to work, the attacker must be a legal Kerberos client so that the KAS will grant him credentials. In particular, he must possess a public/secret key pair (pk I ,sk I ) and valid certificates Cert I trusted by the KAS. The attacker must also be able to intercept messages, which is a standard assumption. Finally, PKINIT must be used in public-key encryption mode, which is commonly done as the alternative DH mode does not appear to be readily available, except for domain specific systems [28,29]. 3.3. Effects of the attack Attackerobservestraffic. Once the attacker learnsAKin the AS exchange, he may either mediateCâs interactions with the various servers (essentially logging in as I while leaking data toCso she believes she has logged in) while observing this traffic or simply impersonate the servers in the later exchanges. In the first variant, which is shown in Fig. 6, onceChasAKand a TGT, she would normally contact the TGS to get an ST for some application server S. This request contains an authenticator of the form {C,t C,T } AK (i.e.,Câs name and a timestamp, encrypted with AK). Because I knows AK, he may intercept the request and replace the authenticator with one that refers to himself: {I,t I,T } AK . The reply from the TGS contains a freshly generated keySK; this is encrypted underAK, for C to read and thus accessible to I, and also included in an ST that is opaque to all but the TGS and application server. I may intercept this message and learnSK, replace an instance of his name withCâs name, and forward the result to C.AsI knows SK, he can carry out a similar MITM attack on the CS exchange, replacing the authenticator {C,t C,S } SK with the authenticator {I,t I,S } SK and then replacing the serverâs reply {t I,S } SK with the reply {t C,S } SK that the client is expecting. This exchange ostensibly authenticates C to the application server; however, because the service ticket names I, this server would believe that he is interacting with I, notC. Attackerimpersonatesservers. Alternatively,theattackermayinterceptCâsrequestsintheTGandCSexchanges and impersonate the involved servers rather than forwarding altered messages to them; the message flow for this version of the attack is shown in Fig. 7. In the TG exchange, I will ignore the TGT and only decrypt the portion of the request encrypted underAK (which he learned during the initial exchange). The attacker will then generate a bogus service ticketX ST , which the client expects to be opaque, and a fresh keySK encrypted (along with other datan 3 ,t T ,S) underAK, and send these toC in what appears to be a properly formatted reply from the TGS. In the CS exchange the attacker may again intercept the clientâs request; in this case, no new keys need to be generated, and the attacker only needs to return the clientâs timestamp encrypted underSKâwhich I himself generated in the previous exchangeâfor C to believe that she has completed this exchange with the application serverS. Note that the attacker may take the first approachâmediating the exchange betweenCand 410 I. Cervesato et al. / Information and Computation 206 (2008) 402â424 Fig. 7. Message flow in the man-in-the-middle attack on PKINIT-26, after the messages in Fig. 5, when the attacker impersonates the TGS and end server; hereTGT ={AK, I,t K } k T whileX ST is a garbage message. a TGSâin the TG exchange and then the secondâimpersonating the application serverâin the CS exchange. The reverse is not possible because I cannot forge a valid ST forS when impersonatingT. Regardless of which approach the attacker uses to propagate the attack throughout the protocol run, C finishes the CS exchange believing that she has interacted with a serverS and thatT has generated a fresh key SK known only toC andS. Instead, I knowsSK in addition to, or instead of,S (depending on how I propagated the attack). Thus I may learn any data thatC attempts to send toS; depending on the type of server involved, such data could be quite sensitive. Note that this attack does not allow I to impersonate C to a TGS or an application server because all involved tickets name I; Section 6.4 discusses a related authentication property. This also means that ifC is in communication with an actual server (T orS), that server will view the client as I, notC. 4. Preventing the attack The attack outlined in the previous section was possible because the two messages constituting the then- current version of PKINIT were insufficiently bound to each other. More precisely, the attack shows that, although a client can link a received response to a previous request (thanks to the nonces n 1 and n 2 , and to the timestamp t C ), she cannot be sure that the KAS generated the key AK and the ticket-granting-ticket TGT appearing in this response for her. Indeed, the only evidence of the principal for whom the KAS generated these credentials appears inside the TGT, which is opaque to her. This suggests one approach to making PKINIT immune to this attack, namely to require the KAS to include the identity of this principal in a component of the response that is integrity-protected and that the client can verify. An obvious mechanism is the submessage signed by the KAS in the reply. Following a methodology we successfully applied in previous work on Kerberos [7,9], we have constructed a formal model of both PKINIT-26 and various possible fixes to this protocol (including the one adopted in PKINIT-27). Details can be found in Section 6. Property 4.1 informally states that PKINIT-27 and subsequent versions satisfy a security property that we see violated in PKINIT-26, demonstrating that this fix does indeed defend against our attack. Property 4.1. In PKINIT-27 (and subsequent versions), whenever a client C processes an AS reply containing server-generated public-key credentials, the KAS previously produced such credentials forC. This property informally expresses the contents of Corollary 6.4, which we prove in Section 6. As we worked on our formal analysis, we solicited feedback from the IETF Kerberos Working Group, and in particular the authors of the PKINIT specifications, about possible fixes we were considering. We also analyzed I. Cervesato et al. / Information and Computation 206 (2008) 402â424 411 Fig. 8. Abstract fix of PKINIT. Fig. 9. Fix of PKINIT adopted in version 27. the fix, proposed by the Working Group, that was included in PKINIT-27 and subsequent revisions of this specification [25]. 4.1. Abstract fix Having traced the origin of the discovered attack to the fact that the client cannot verify that the received credentials (the TGT and the keyAK) were generated for her, the problem can be fixed by having the KAS include Câs name in the reply in such a way that it cannot be modified en route and thatC can check it. Following well- established recommendations [40], we initially proposed a simple and minimally intrusive approach to doing so: includingCâs name in the portion of the reply signed by the KAS (in PKINIT-26, this is [k,n 2 ] sk K ). We then generalized it by observing that the KAS can sign k and any message fragment F(C,n i ) that is suitably built from Câs name and at least one of the nonces n 1 and n 2 from Câs request for credentials. With this abstract fix in place, the PKINIT exchange in public-key encryption mode is depicted in Fig. 8, where we have used a box to highlight the modification with respect to PKINIT-26. Here F represents any construction that injectively involves C and either n 1 or n 2 âi.e., F(C,n i ) = F(C prime ,n prime i ) implies C = C prime and n i = n prime i âand is verifiable by the client. Integrity protection is guaranteed by the fact that it appears inside a component signed by the KAS, and therefore is non-malleable by the attacker (assuming that the KASâs signature keys are secure). Intuitively, this defends against the attack since the clientC can now verify that the KAS generated the received credentials for her and not for another principal (such as I in our attack). Indeed, an honest KAS will produce the signature ([k,F(C,n i )] sk K ) only in response to a request from C. The presence of the nonces n 1 or n 2 uniquely identifies which of the (possibly several) requests fromCto which this reply corresponds. Note that the fact that we do not needF to mention bothn 1 andn 2 entails that the noncen 2 is superfluous as far as authentication is concerned. We will formally prove that this variant defends against the attack in Section 6. A simple instance of this general schema consists in taking F(C,n i ) to be (C,n 2 ), yielding the signed data [k,C,n 2 ] sk K , which corresponds to simply includingCâs name within the signed portion of the PKINIT-26 reply. This version is very similar to the initial target of our formal verification. We showed that indeed it defeats the reported attack and satisfied the formal authentication property violated in PKINIT-26. Only later did we generalize the proof to refer to the abstract construction F. Its correctness will follow as a simple corollary of the validity of our general schema, as we will show in Section 6. 4.2. Solution adopted in PKINIT-27 When we discussed our initial fix with the authors of the PKINIT document, we received the request to apply our methodology to verify a different solution: rather than simply includingCâs name in the signed portion of the reply, replace the nonce n 2 there with a keyed hash (âchecksumâ in Kerberos terminology) taken over the 412 I. Cervesato et al. / Information and Computation 206 (2008) 402â424 clientâs entire request. We did so and showed that this approach also defeats our attack. It is on the basis of this finding that we distilled the general fix discussed above, of which both solutions are instances. The IETF Kerberos Working Group later decided to include the checksum-based approach in PKINIT-27 and its subsequent revisions [25]. The message flow of this version of PKINIT is displayed in Fig. 9. Here, ck is a checksum of the clientâs request keyed with the key k, i.e., ck has the form H k (Cert C , [t C ,n 2 ] sk C ,C,T,n 1 ) where H is a preimage-resistant MAC function. This means that it is computationally infeasible for the at- tacker to find a message whose checksum matches that of a given message. Following the specifications in [41], which discusses cryptographic algorithms for use in the Kerberos protocol suite, current candidates for H include hmac-sha1-96-aes128. New strong keyed checksums can be used for ck as they are devel- oped. 5. Formalizing PKINIT in MSR We have formalized PKINIT in the language MSR [9,31,32] and used this specification to verify the cor- rectness of the proposed fixes. MSR is a flexible framework for specifying complex cryptographic protocols, possibly structured as a collection of coordinated subprotocols. It uses strongly typed multiset rewriting rules over first-order atomic formulas to express protocol actions and relies on a form of existential quantification to symbolically model the generation of fresh data (e.g., nonces or short-term keys). 5.1. Terms and types MSR represents network messages and their components as first-order terms. Thus the TGT {AK,C,t K } k T sent from K to C is modeled as the term obtained by applying the binary encryption symbol {_} _ to the constant k T and the subterm (AK,C,t K ). This subterm is built using atomic terms and two applications of the binary concatenation symbol (â_, _â). For simplicity, we retain the semi-formal message syntax used ear- lier. Terms are classified by types, which describe their intended meaning and restrict the set of terms that can be legally constructed. For example, {_} _ accepts a key (type key) and a message (type msg), produc- ing a term of type msg; using a nonce as the key yields an ill-formed term. Nonces, principal names, etc., often appear within messages; MSR uses the subsort relation to facilitate this. For example, defining nonce to be a subsort of msg (written nonce<: msg) allows nonces to be treated as messages. Both term con- structors and types are definable. This allows us to formalize the specialized principals of Kerberos 5 as subsorts of the generic principal type: we introduce types client, KAS, TGS and server, with the obvious meanings. MSR supports more structured type definitions [31]. Dependent types allow capturing the binding between a key and the principals for whom it was created. For example, the fact that a short-term key k is intended to be shared between a particular clientC and serverS is expressed by declaring it to be of type shK CS. Because k is a key, shK CSis a subsort of key (for all C and S), and since k is short term this type is also a subsort of msg as k needs to be transmitted in a message. We similarly model the long-term keys that a principal A shares with the KAS as objects of type dbK A, which is again a subsort of key but not of msg; these keys are not intended to be sent over the network, and this typing prohibits this. Dependent types give us elegant means to describe the public-key machinery. If (pk,sk) is the public/secret key pair of principal A, we simply declare pkof type pubK Aandsk of type secK pk. Secret keys, like the long-term keys, are not intended to be sent over the messages; thus the type secKpkis a subsort of key but not of msg. Although we do not explicitly include public keys in messages here, pubKAis a subsort of msg. The constructors for encryption and digital signature are written {{m}} pk and [m] sk , respectively, as in the text so far. Other types used in the formalization of PKINIT include time for timestamps, CertList for lists of digital certificates, and someSecK as an auxiliary type for working with digital signatures. The use of someSecK allows us, e.g., to model a signed message without declaring the public key or its owner that correspond to the signing key; in order to verify the signature we use the predicateVerifySigtogether with a list of certificates (as in Fig. 10) instead of a specific public key. We also use the constructor H k (m) to model the checksum (keyed hash) of messagemkeyed with symmetric keyk. I. Cervesato et al. / Information and Computation 206 (2008) 402â424 413 Fig. 10. KASâs role in the abstract fix version of the PKINIT AS exchange. 5.2. States, rules, and the formalization of PKINIT The state of a protocol execution is determined by the network messages in transit, the local knowledge of each principal, and other similar data. MSR formalizes individual bits of information in a state by means of facts consisting of predicate name and one or more terms. For example, the network fact N({AK,C,t K } k T ) indicates that the term {AK,C,t K } k T , a TGT, is present on the network, andI({AK,C,t K } k T )that it is known by the attacker. A protocol consists of actions that transform the state. In MSR, this is modeled by the notion of rule:a description of the facts that an action removes from the current state and the facts it replaces them with to produce the next state. For example, Fig. 10 describes the actions of the KAS in the abstract fix of PKINIT (see Section 4) whereF(C,n i )stands for a construction that containsC and eithern 1 orn 2 (or both). Ignoring for the moment the leading âK : KAS and the outermost brackets leaves us with a single MSR ruleâlabeledDC3 2.1 above the arrowâthat we will use to illustrate characteristics of MSR rules in general. Rules are parametric, as evidenced by the leading string of typed universal quantifiers: actual values need to be supplied before applying the rule. The middle portion (Â·Â·Â·equal1âÂ·Â·Â·) describes the transformation performed by the rule: it replaces states containing a fact of the form N(Cert C , [t C ,n 2 ] skC ,C,T,n 1 )with states that contain the fact on its right-hand side but which are otherwise identical. The existential marker ââAK : shK CTâ requires AK to be replaced with a newly generated symbol of type shK CT, and similarly for ââk : shK CKâ; this is how freshness requirements are modeled in MSR. The last line, starting with the keyword IF, further constrains the applicability of the rule by requiring that certain predicates be present (differently from the left-hand side, they are not removed as a result of applying the rule). Here, we use the predicates VerifySig to verify that a digital signature is valid given a list of credentials (VerifySig(s;m;P,Certs) holds if s is the signature, relative to certificatesCerts, by principalP over the messagem). Additionally, we useValid K to capture the local policy ofK in issuing tickets, andClock K to model the local clock ofK. While the entities following âIFâ are logically facts, in practice they are often handled procedurally, outside of MSR. Rule DC3 2.1 completely describes the behavior of the KAS; in general, multiple rules may be needed, as when modeling the actions of the client in the AS exchange. Coordinated rules describing the behavior of a principal are collected in a role. A role is just a sequence of rules, parameterized by the principal executing them (their owner)âthe ââK : KASâ above the brackets in Fig. 10. The two-rule role describing the clientâs actions of the abstract fix version of PKINIT is displayed in Fig. 11. Formalizations of the TG and CS exchanges can be found in Appendix 7, with detailed explanations in [7,9,42]. 5.3. Execution semantics Going into more detail, the execution semantics of MSR operates by transforming not states (as introduced in the previous section) but configurations of the form ãSã R Sigma1 , where S is a state, the signature Sigma1 contains the symbols being used (with their type), and the active role setR = (rho a 1 1 ,...,SUB a n n )records the remaining actions of the currently present roles (SUB i ) together with the principals executing them (a i ). 414 I. Cervesato et al. / Information and Computation 206 (2008) 402â424 Fig. 11. Clientâs role in the abstract fix version of the PKINIT AS exchange. Basic execution steps are expressed by judgments of the form P trianglerightC ââ C prime where P is the protocol speci- fication, and C and C prime are consecutive configurations. These judgments are defined by the following two rules (which are somewhat simplified from [43]): (P,SUB)trianglerightãSã R Sigma1 ââ ãSã R,SUB a Sigma1 inst P trianglerightãS, [DC2]lhsã R,((lhsââvectorx.rhs),SUB) a Sigma1 ââ ãS, [DC2, vectorc/vectorx]rhsã R,SUB a Sigma1,vectorc rw The rule inst prepares a role for execution by inserting it in the active role set: it associates the role with the principal a that will be executing it. The same role can be loaded arbitrarily many times by any principal (subject to some typing limitations), which provides support for the concurrent execution of multiple sessions and therefore also for multi-session attacks. The inference rw describes the application of a state transforming rule r = lhs â rhs introduced in the previous section: if an instance [DC2]lhs of its left-hand side appears in the state, it is replaced by the corresponding instantiation of the right-hand side ofrafter instantiating the existential variables vectorx with new constants vectorc. The ruler is then removed from the active role set of the configuration, and vectorc is added to the signature. In order to present rule application in a compact yet precise way, the notion of an abstract execution step is used which denotes a quadrupleC r,DC3 ââC prime . Here,C andC prime are consecutive configurations,r identifies the rule from P being executed, andDC3stands for the overall substitution [DC2, vectorc/vectorx] above. We say thatr is applicable inC if there exist a substitutionDC3and a configurationC prime such thatC r,DC3 ââC prime is defined. A trace T is then a sequence of the form C 0 r 1 ,DC3 1 ââ C 1 r 2 ,DC3 2 ââ Â·Â·Â· r n ,DC3 n ââ C n+1 where C 0 =ãS 0 ã R 0 Sigma1 0 is called the initial configuration of T . In the context of Kerberos, the state component S 0 of the initial configuration contains only the predicates used in constraints (e.g., VerifySig in Fig. 11), and the intruderâs knowledge (see next section); in particular, no network message or memory predicate is contained in S 0 . The initial signatureSigma1 0 withinC 0 contains the names of all principals together with their types (client, server, KAS, etc.), and their keys, etc. The initial active role setR 0 withinC 0 is empty. Note that we only need to consider finite traces, because execution (in any networked computer system) proceeds by discrete steps and started at a specific moment in time. Likewise, a generic trace will contain only a finite, although a priori unbounded, number of applications of inference inst for the same roleSUB. I. Cervesato et al. / Information and Computation 206 (2008) 402â424 415 5.4. Intruder model The intruder model in our analysis of public-key Kerberos is a variant of the classic DolevâYao intruder model [37,44]. The attacker in this model can traditionally intercept and originate network traffic, encrypt and decrypt captured messages as long as he knows the correct key, concatenate and split messages at will, generate certain types of messages (e.g., keys and nonces) but not others (e.g., principals), and access public data such as principal names. This set of intruder capabilities is given a precise specification in MSR. For this purpose, the knowledge of the intruder is modeled as a collection of facts I(m) (âthe intruder knows message mâ) distributed in the state. The intruder himself is represented as the distinguished principal I by means of the declaration I : principal. Each capability is expressed by means of a one-rule role that can be executed only by I. For example, the specifications of network message interception, message splitting and nonce generation have the following form: I bracketleftBigg âm : msg N(m) INT equal1â I(m) bracketrightBigg I bracketleftBigg âm 1 ,m 2 : msg I(m 1 ), I(m 2 ) CPM equal1â I(m 1 ,m 2 ) bracketrightBigg I bracketleftBigg Â· NG equal1â ân : nonce I(n) bracketrightBigg NoticethattheserolesidentifyIastheirowner(abovetheleftbrace)ratherthanagenericprincipal(introduced by a universal quantifier in the previous section). Because public-key Kerberos relies on more than shared keys, we extend our earlier intruder formalization with the following rules for public-key encryption and decryption. These allow the intruder to learn any public- key of any principal P, or to learn any of his own secret keys (but not those of other principals), and then to encrypt and decrypt if the proper keys are known. I bracketleftBigg âP : principal âpk: pubK P . PK prime equal1â I(pk) bracketrightBigg I bracketleftBigg âpk: pubK I âsk : secKsk . SK prime equal1â I(sk) bracketrightBigg I â¡ â£ âP : principal âpk: pubK P âm : msg I(m),I(pk) PEC prime equal1â I({{m}} pk ) â¤ â¦ I â¡ â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ â£ âP : principal âpk: pubK P âsk : secK pk âm : msg I({{m}} pk ),I(sk) PDEC prime equal1â I(m) â¤ â¥ â¥ â¥ â¥ â¥ â¦ Signing is handled similarly as shown in rule SIG below. Rather than having the intruder verify signatures, an activity an attacker will rarely bother with (although it could easily be modeled in MSR), rule PEEK allows him to extract a message from a signature. It should be noted that this specification deemphasizes the PKI infrastructure on which PKINIT relies as it confines the use of certificates to the predicate VerifySig. A more explicit treatment is unnecessary in this case. I â¡ â£ âP : principal âpk: pubK P âsk : secK pk âm : msg I(m), I(sk) SIG equal1â I([m] sk ) â¤ â¦ I bracketleftBigg âsk : someSecK âm : msg I([m] sk ) PEEK equal1â I(m) bracketrightBigg Because secret keys are typed like long-term keys, we add specific rules allowing duplication and deletion in memory of known secret keys (paralleling the rules DPD and DLD from [42]). These are straightforward, and we omit the specific rules here. 416 I. Cervesato et al. / Information and Computation 206 (2008) 402â424 Fig. 12. The definition ofSUB k (m;m 0 ), thek-rank ofmrelative tom 0 . The remaining rules implementing the other traditional DolevâYao intruder capabilities are defined similarly. A complete list for basic Kerberos can be found in [42]. 6. Formal analysis of PKINIT Our formal proofs rely on a double induction aimed at separating the confidentiality and authentication aspects of the analysis of Kerberos 5. Confidentiality and authentication can interact in complex ways, requiring both types of functions in a single proof. (This is not so much the case in the AS exchange, because the security of this first exchange does not rely on properties of earlier rounds, but it is seen clearly in the later rounds as illustrated in [7,42].) Our proofs are supported by two classes of functions, rank and corank, whose definitions we recall in Section 6.1. We prove the correctness of the fixed protocol in Section 6.2, discuss other authentication properties in Sections 6.3 and 6.4, and then state and prove auxiliary lemmas in Section 6.5. 6.1. Rank and corank We start by reviewing the definition of rank and corank functions as originally given in [7,8,42] and extended to include the cryptographic primitives that PKINIT adds to basic Kerberos. We start by defining these classes of functions inductively on terms and then extend the definitions to facts. Rank. Rank captures the amount of work done using a specific key to encrypt a specified message. For a cryptographic keyk and a fixed messagem 0 , we define the k-rank of a message m relative tom 0 as shown in Fig. 12. If m is an atomic term, then no work has been done using k, and we set the rank to 0. If m is exactly {m 0 } k , {{m 0 }} k ,or[m 0 ] k , then we set the rank to 1. Encrypting or signing a message m of positive k-rank will increase the rank by 1 in case one uses the keyk, whereas using a keyk prime /= k will have no effect on thek-rank ofmrelative to m 0 . The rank of the concatenation of two messages is set to be the larger of the ranks of the constituent messages. The extension of the rank function to facts is straightforward. For a key k and for m 0 of type msg, and termst,t i , andP any predicate in the protocol signature, we define thek-rank of a factP(t 1 ,...,t j )relative tom 0 I. Cervesato et al. / Information and Computation 206 (2008) 402â424 417 Fig. 13. Definition of ËSUB E (m;m 0 ), theE-corank ofmrelative tom 0 . by SUB k (P(t 1 ,...,t j );m 0 ) = max 1lessorequalslantilessorequalslantj SUB k (t i ;m 0 ). E.g., for network facts the k-rank relative to m 0 is SUB k (N(m);m 0 ) = SUB k (m;m 0 ). Our rank functions are most closely connected to data origin authentication, although they are used in conjunction with corank functions in many proofs [8]. The relationship between rank and authentication follows Theorem 6.1, which was outlined in [8]. Theorem 6.1. IfSUB k (F;m 0 ) = 0 for every factF in the initial state of a generic trace T and if no intruder rule can increase thek-rank relative tom 0 then the existence of a factF withSUB k (F;m 0 )>0 in some non-initial state of T implies that some honest principal fired a rule which produced a fact build up from {m 0 } k . As in [42] (although stated there without some of the primitives needed to model PKINIT), if an intruder rule increasesk-rank relative tom 0 , then the left-hand side of that rule containsI(k). Thus, if we show thatI(k)never appears in a trace, we may invoke Theorem 6.1 to help prove authentication. Corank. Corank captures the minimum effort needed, using keys from a specified set, to extract a (possibly) secret message from a given term. For a setE of keys, none of which is a public key, and a fixed atomic message m 0 , we define the E-corank of message m relative tom 0 as shown in Fig. 13.Ifmis atomic andm = m 0 , then no work using keys fromE is needed to obtainm 0 , and we set the corank to 0. Ifmis atomic andm/= m 0 , then no amount of such work can extractm 0 . The number of decryptions needed to obtainm 0 from {m} k using keys from E is 1 more than or the same as the number of decryptions needed to obtainm 0 fromm, depending on whether k (if the encryption is symmetric) or some k prime : secKk (if the encryption is asymmetric) is an element of E or not. The corank of the concatenation of two messages is equal to the smaller of the coranks of the constituent messages. The extension of the corank function to facts is slightly different from that of the rank function. The definition of corank of a fact depends on the predicate P in which it occurs. For example, for the network predicate N() we define ËSUB E (N(m);m 0 ) =ËSUB E (m;m 0 ), while for the clientâs memory predicate Auth C (used in the rules in Figs. 11, A.1, and A.3) we define ËSUB E (Auth C (t 1 ,t 2 ,t 3 );m 0 ) =ËSUB E (t 1 ;m 0 ). This follows our informal rule [7,8] that the corank of a fact depends only on the arguments of the predicate that might be put onto the network. Our corank functions are closely connected to confidentiality, which we typically prove by invoking the following theorem from [8]. Theorem 6.2. If ËSUB E (F;m 0 )>0 for every fact in the initial state of a generic trace T , if no intruder can decrease the E-corank relative tom 0 , and if no honest principal creates a factF with ËSUB E (F;m 0 ) = 0, thenm 0 is secret throughout T. 6.2. Correctness of the fix We now present the theorem that establishes the correctness of the abstract fix to PKINIT introduced in Section 4.1. This, in turn, implies the correctness of PKINIT-27 and subsequent versions of PKINIT (including the final specification)âi.e., that Property 4.1 holdsâbecause these use a special case of the abstract fix. In 418 I. Cervesato et al. / Information and Computation 206 (2008) 402â424 the following we will assume that F(C,n i ) = F(C prime ,n prime i ) implies C = C prime and n i = n prime i , for any C,C prime : client and n i ,n prime i : nonce (fori = 1, 2). Theorem 6.3. If (1) the fact N({{Cert K , [k,F(C,n i )] sk K }} pk C ,C,X, {AK,n 1 ,t K ,T} k ) appears in a trace, for some C : client, K : KAS, k : shK CK, sk K : someSecK, X : msg, Cert K : CertList, pk C : pubKC, T : TGS, AK : shK CT, n i ,n 1 : nonce, andt K : time; (2) the factVerifySig([k,F(C,n i )] sk K ;(k,F(C,n i ));K,Cert K )holds; and (3) for every pk K : pubKK and sk : secKpk K , the fact I(sk) does not appear in the trace and no fact in the initial state of the trace contained a fact of positivesk-rank relative to(k,F(C,n i )), then the KAS K fired rule DC3 2.1 , consuming the fact N(Cert C , [t C ,n 2 ] sk C ,C,T,n 1 ) and creating the fact N({{Cert K , [k,F(C,n i )] sk K }} pk C ,C, {AK,C,t K } k T , {AK,n 1 ,t K ,T} k ),forsomeCert C : CertList,sk C : secK pk C ,n 2 : nonce, t C ,t K : time,k T : dbK T. Proof.BecauseVerifySig([k,F(C,n i )] sk K ;(k,F(C,n i ));K,Cert K )holds,byLemma6.10thereissomesk : secK pk K suchthatSUB sk ([k,F(C,n i )] sk K ;(k,F(C,n i )))> 0(wherepk K : pubKK).ThusthefactN({{Cert C , [k,F(C,n i )] sk K }} pk C , C,X, {AK,n 1 ,t K ,T} k )has positivesk-rank relative to(k,F(C,n i )); by hypothesis, no such fact existed in the initial state of the trace, so some rule firing during the trace must have increased this rank. By hypothesis, I(sk) does not appear in the initial state of the trace, so by Lemma 6.14 I(sk) does not ap- pear in any state of the trace. By Lemma 6.11, this means that no rule fired by the intruder can increase sk- rank relative to (k,F(C,n i )); thus, by Theorem 6.1, at some point in this trace an honest principal must have fired a rule that increased this rank. By inspection of the principal rules, the only one that can do this is rule DC3 2.1 ; in order for this rule to do so, it must be fired by the KAS K who owns sk, consume a network fact N(Cert C prime, [t,n prime 2 ] sk C prime ,C prime ,T prime ,n prime 1 ) for some t : time, n prime 2 ,n prime 1 : nonce, Cert C prime : CertList, C prime : client, and T prime : TGS, and produce the fact N({{Cert K , [k,F(C prime ,n prime i )] sk }} pk C prime ,C prime , {AK prime ,C prime ,t prime K } k T prime , {AK prime ,n prime 1 ,t prime K ,T prime } k )for someCert K : CertList, sk : someSecK,pk C prime : pubKC prime ,AK prime : shK C prime T prime ,t prime K : time,k T prime : dbK T prime ,n prime 1 : nonce, andF(C prime ,n prime i ) = F(C,n i ).By assumption,(C prime ,n prime i ) = (C,n i ), which implies that the request thatK processed must match the request described in the hypotheses. square The following corollary specializes the result in Theorem 6.3 to the particular fix used in PKINIT-27 and to the clientâs receipt of the network message described in the hypotheses of this theorem. It is the formal statement of Property 4.1, which says that ifC processes a reply message (containing the signed checksum of a request that C previously sent), then some KASK must have sent a reply message intended forC. Corollary 6.4. If (1) SomeC : client fires ruleDC3 1.2 , consuming the fact N({{Cert K , [k,ck] sk K }} pk C ,C,X, {AK,n 1 ,t K ,T} k )and produc- ing the factAuth C (X,T,AK)for some K : KAS, k : shK CK, sk K : someSecK, ck,X : msg, Cert K : CertList, pk C : pubKC, T : TGS, AK : shK CT,n 1 : nonce,t K : time, and (2)ck= H k (Cert C , [t C ,n 2 ] sk C ,C,T,n 1 ), for somet C : time,n 2 : nonce,Cert C : CertList,sk C : SecK pk C , and (3) for everypk K : pubKK andsk : secKpk K , the factI(sk)does not appear in the trace and no fact in the initial state of the trace contained a fact of positivesk-rank relative to(k,ck), then the KAS K fired rule DC3 2.1 , consuming the fact N(Cert C , [t C ,n 2 ] sk C ,C,T,n 1 ) and creating the fact N({{Cert K , [k,ck] sk K }} pk C ,C, {AK,C,t K } k T , {AK,n 1 ,t K ,T} k ), for somek T : dbK T,t K : time. I. Cervesato et al. / Information and Computation 206 (2008) 402â424 419 Proof. This follows by letting F(C,n i ) = ck = H k (Cert C , [t C ,n 2 ] sk C ,C,T,n 1 ) in Theorem 6.3; this construction satisfies the assumptions onF(C,n i )for bothi = 1 andi = 2.Câs rule firing implies that the first two hypotheses of the theorem hold; the third hypothesis of the corollary specializes the third hypothesis of the theorem to the case ofck = F(C,n i ), which implies the conclusion for somen prime 1 ,n prime 2 : nonce andCert prime C : CertList.Câs firing of rule DC3 1.2 (when specialized to the checksum) implies that then prime 1 = n 1 ,n prime 2 = n 2 , andCert prime C = Cert C . square As a further remark, if in the abstract fix of PKINIT from Section 4.1 one chooses F(C,n i ) = F(C,n 1 ), the proof of Theorem 6.3 shows that authentication of the KAS to the client still holds. In fact, the KAS does not return any information containingn 2 . This means that the following holds. Property 6.5. The signed nonce n 2 in the clientâs AS request is superfluous for the purpose of authentication in PKINIT. This property does not imply that n 2 can simply be omitted from the first message of PKINIT in general, as some signed session identifiers is necessary to correctly support authentication as in Property 6.6 below. Rather, it suggests that it could be simplified by replacing every occurrence ofn 2 withn 1 . 6.3. Authentication ofC toK While our primary focus here is on the authentication ofK toC, becauseC signs a nonce in her request we may also prove authentication ofC toK; note that this holds in both the broken and fixed versions of PKINIT, as the fix does not affectCâs request or our reasoning about it. Informally, we state this as the following property. Property 6.6. If a KAS processes a PKINIT request from a clientC, then previouslyC sent a PKINIT request that contained the signed data in the message received and processed by the KAS. Formally, we state this property as the following theorem. Theorem 6.7. If (1) Some K : KAS fires rule DC3 2.1 , consuming the fact N(Cert C , [t C ,n 2 ] sk ,C,T,n 1 ) for some Cert C : CertList, t C : time,n 1 ,n 2 : nonce,sk : someSecK,C : client, andT : TGS; and (2) for everypk: pubKC andsk : secKpk, the factI(sk)does not appear in the trace and no fact in the initial state of the trace contained a fact of positivesk-rank relative to(t C ,n 2 ), then atsomepointearlierinthetrace,theclientCfiredruleDC3 1.1 ,generatingthefactN(t C ,n 2 ,Cert prime C , [t C ,n 2 ] sk C ,C,T prime ,n prime 1 ) for someCert prime C : CertList,T prime : TGS, andn prime 1 : nonce. Proof.Having assumed thatKfired ruleDC3 2.1 , the factVerifySig([t C ,n 2 ] sk ;(t C ,n 2 );C,Cert C )must hold. By Lemma 6.10, the fact consumed by this rule firing has positive sk-rank relative to (t C ,n 2 ). By hypothesis, no such fact appeared in the initial state of the trace, so some rule that was fired during the trace increased this rank. Also by hypothesis, I(sk) cannot appear in the trace, so by Lemma 6.11, the intruder cannot increase this rank. By inspection of the principal rules, the only rule that can increase this rank is ruleDC3 1.1 when fired byC to create the fact N(t C ,n 2 ,Cert prime C , [t C ,n 2 ] sk C ,C,T prime ,n prime 1 )for someCert prime C : CertList,T prime : TGS, andn prime 1 : nonce. square 6.4. Authentication in the pre-fix protocol Our attack in Section 3 showed that an intruder could impersonate a KAS to a client. This means that KAS-to-client authentication does not hold when PKINIT-26 is used, in the sense that a client might receive a reply containing her name that appears to come from some KAS but without any KAS having ever sent such a message. However, PKINIT-26 does provide some authentication with respect to the later exchanges 420 I. Cervesato et al. / Information and Computation 206 (2008) 402â424 as shown by Property 6.8 below, and this property still holds in the fixed protocol (PKINIT-27 and later ver- sions). Property 6.8. If TGST processes a valid request message naming a clientC, and the key used to encrypt the TGT which was contained in that request message was secret when the system started, then earlier the KASK generated a TGT namingC. Furthermore, ifCâs private key was initially secret(so thatC is honest), thenC sent a request to T afterK sent a corresponding AS reply toC. As a consequence, we see that even if the intruder is carrying out the attack by letting C login to T and S as the intruder (so that the intruder can watch the traffic between them), some KAS must have created a TGT for the intruder, formalizing the requirement that the intruder be a legal user of the system. Furthermore, this shows that whileC might successfully ârequestâ a service ticket as the intruder in the attack scenario, it requires the participation of the intruder; in particular,C could not obtain a TGT that names an honest clientC prime if the relevant keys are secret. Theorem 6.9 formalizes this property; the relevant MSR roles for the TG and CS exchanges can be found in Appendix 7. Theorem 6.9. If (1)T:TGS fires rule DC3 4.1 consuming the fact N({AK,C,t K } k T , {AK,n 3 , t K , T} k , C,S) and creating the fact N(C, {SK,C} k S , {SK,n 3 ,S} AK )forsomeAK : shK CT,C : client,K : KAS,t K : time,k T : dbK T,n 3 : nonce, S : server, and (2) the fact I(k T ) does not appear in the trace and no fact in the initial state of the trace contained a fact of positivek T -rank relative to {AK,C,t K }, and (3) the factI(sk C )is not inferable in the initial state of the trace for everysk C : SecKpk C , then (i) the KAS K earlier fired rule DC3 2.1 , creating a fact N({Cert K , [k,H k (Cert C , [t C ,n 2 ] skC ,C,T,n 1 )] sk K } pk C , C, {AK,C,t K } k T , {AK,n 1 ,t K ,T} k )for someCert K ,Cert C : CertList,n 1 ,n 2 : nonce, and (ii)C fired rule DC3 3.1 , creating the fact N({AK,C,t K } k T , {AK,n 3 ,t K ,T} k ,C,S) in a state later in the trace than the state at whichK fired ruleDC3 2.1 producing the fact described above. Proof. We start with consideration of k T -rank relative to (AK,C,t K ). Tâs hypothesized rule firing consumed a fact for which this rank is positive, but by assumption this rank was 0 for every fact in the initial state of the trace. Thus some rule firing in the trace increased this rank. Because I(k T ) does not appear in the initial state of the trace, by Lemma 6.13 this fact never appears in the trace. Thus, by Lemma 6.11, the intruder cannot have increased k T -rank relative to (AK,C,t K ), so some honest principal must have done this. Inspection of the principal rules shows that ifk has type dbK T for some T : TGS, then the only honest principals that increase k-rank relative to any message are those of type KAS through the firing of rule DC3 2.1 . Thus some K : KAS fired rule DC3 2.1 , which must have consumed and produced the facts claimed. We now show that AK is secret by considering {k,k T }-corank relative to AK. Kâs firing of rule DC3 2.1 freshly generatesAK, so all previous states had infinite {k,k T }-corank relative toAK, and the state that results from this rule firing has {k,k T }-corank equal to 1 relative toAK. As noted above,I(k T )never appears in the trace; we must show that I(k) does not either. Kâs firing of rule DC3 2.1 also freshly generated k, so all previous states had infinite E-corank relative tok for every setE; furthermore, the resulting state has {sk C }-corank equal to 1 relative tok. BecauseI(sk C )was not inferable from the initial state of the trace, by Lemma 6.14 this fact never appears in the trace. Thus, by Lemma 6.12, the intruder cannot decrease {sk C }-corank relative tok. Inspection of the principal rules show that no honest principal will do this either; note that whileC decrypts the message containingk, she does not store this key, much less in a predicate that will allow it to be put onto the network. Therefore no state in the trace has {sk C }-corank equal to 0 relative tok,soI(k)never appears in the trace. I. Cervesato et al. / Information and Computation 206 (2008) 402â424 421 Because neither I(k T ) nor I(k) ever appear in the trace, the intruder cannot decrease {k,k T }-corank relative to AK. By inspection, we see that the only principal rule which decreases this corank is rule DC3 2.1 when it is fired to freshly generate AK. As noted above, the resulting state must have {k,k T }-corank equal to 1 relative to AK; no principal rule will decrease this corank to 0. Thus no fact of {k,k T }-corank equal to 0 relative toAK, and in particular the factI(AK), appears in the trace. We may now show thatC fired ruleDC3 3.1 in the claimed fashion.Tâs hypothesized rule firing also consumed a fact ofAK-rank equal to 1 relative toC,t C . BecauseAK was freshly generated during the trace (as shown above) and I(AK) never appears in the trace, some honest principal must have fired a rule that increased AK-rank relative toC,t C . By inspection, we see that the only such principal rule is ruleDC3 3.1 , which must produce the fact N(X, {C,t C } AK ,C,S,n 3 ) for some X : msg, t C : time, S : server, and n 3 : nonce. Because this fact has positive AK-rank relative toC,t C andAK was freshly generated byK, we know thatCâs firing of ruleDC3 3.1 occurred after Kâs firing of ruleDC3 2.1 . square 6.5. Lemmas Anumberoflemmasgivingconditionsunderwhichvariousranksandcorankscanbeincreasedanddecreased by rule firings can be found in [42]. However, we need to add to them as public-key operations where not considered in that work. Lemma 6.10. If VerifySig(s;m;P,Certs) holds, then for some pk: pubKP and sk : secK pk, the sk-rank of s relative tomis positive. Proof. Our assumptions aboutVerifySigimply thatsis a valid signature ofmunder one ofPâs secret keys, i.e., for somepk: pubKP andsk : secK pk,s =[m] sk . Thusshas positivesk-rank relative tom. square The following lemmas were proved in [42] for the formalizations of basic Kerberos considered there. These property still holds here once we add asymmetric encryption and digital signatures. Lemma 6.11. If an intruder ruleRcan increasek-rank relative to a messagem 0 , then the left-hand side ofRcontains I(k). Proof. By inspection of the intruder rules. square Lemma 6.12. If m 0 is not a principal name, time, or key of one of the types dbK I, shK IA(for A : TGS or A : server),shK CIfor C : client, or pubKP for P : principal, then any intruder rule that decreases E-corank relative tom 0 either containsI(k)in its left hand side for somek â E or freshly generatesm 0 . Proof. By inspection of the intruder rules. square The following lemma is an analog of Lemma 6 in [42]; the additional intruder rules do not change it. Lemma 6.13. For any P : principal, P/= I, and k : dbK P, if I(k) does not appear in the initial state of the trace, thenI(k)does not appear in any state of the trace. Proof. By inspection of the intruder rules. Because dbK P is not a subtype of msg,ifP/= I thenI(k)appears on the right-hand side of a rule only if it also appears on the left-hand side. square The next lemma is analogous to the previous one, but it refers to secret keys for asymmetric encryption instead of the keys in the KASâs database. Lemma 6.14. For anyP : principal,pubk : pubKP,P/= I, andk : secKpubk, ifI(k)does not appear in the initial state of the trace, thenI(k)does not appear in any state of the trace. Proof. By inspection of the intruder rules. Because secKpubk is not a subtype of msg, for k : secKpubk, the only timeI(k)may appear on the right-hand side of an intruder rule but not on the left-hand side is in rule SK prime , in which caseP = I. square 422 I.

Conclusions and future work In this paper, we describe our discovery of a man-in-the-middle attack against PKINIT [25], the public-key extension to the popular Kerberos 5 authentication protocol [1]. The attack was found on PKINIT-25, but applies to previous versions as well. We found this attack as part of an ongoing formal analysis of Kerberos, which has previously yielded proofs of security for the core Kerberos 5 protocol [7,8] and its use for cross-realm authentication [9]. We have used formal methods approaches to prove that, at an abstract level, several possible defenses against our attack restore security properties of Kerberos 5 that are violated in PKINIT (as shown by the attack); we also proved some security properties that do hold even for the vulnerable form of PKINIT. The fixes we analyzed include the one proposed by the IETF Kerberos Working Group, which included it in the specification of PKINIT starting with revision 27 [25]. Our attack was also addressed in a Microsoft security bulletin affecting several versions of Windows [4] and mentioned in a CERT advisory [26]. Asacontinuationofthisresearch,wehavecarriedoversomeoftheresultsexaminedheretothecomputational model by expressing PKINIT and other aspects of Kerberos in the cryptographic library model of Backes, Pfitzmann and Waidner (BPW model) [45]. The main outcome of this effort was that the fixes examined here were proved to be correct at the cryptographic level [21]. The computationally sound proofs in the BPW model were conducted symbolically by hand [21] and there appears to be a strong relation to the symbolic proof technique used in this work. Gaining a better understanding of how these two methods relate will be subject to future work. If a suitable connection to the BPW framework is discovered, it could contribute to the automation of proof in the cryptographic model [46], which will have the effect of speeding up the analysis work and, therefore, allowing us to tackle larger protocols. We have also started to mechanically verify security properties of PKINIT directly within the computational model [22] using Blanchetâs CryptoVerif tool [23,24]. We are also in the process of extending our analysis to the DiffieâHellman mode of PKINIT: our preliminary observations suggest that it is immune from the attack described in this paper, but we do not yet have definite results on other types of threats. Appendix A. MSR roles for later exchanges Here we recall the MSR roles for the TG and CS exchanges. These are the same as for basic Kerberos because PKINIT only modifies the AS exchange. Fig. A.1 shows the clientâs role in the TG exchange. The memory predicate Auth C (X,T,AK)comes from the AS exchange (formalized in Fig. 11 above). Fig. A.1. The clientâs role in TG exchange. I.

Abstract We report on a man-in-the-middle attack on PKINIT, the public key extension of the widely deployed Kerberos 5 authentication protocol. This flaw allows an attacker to impersonate Kerberos administrative principals (KDC) and end-servers to a client, hence breaching the authentication guarantees of Kerberos. It also gives the attacker the keys that the KDC would normally generate to encrypt the service requests of this client, hence defeating confidentiality as well. The discovery of this attack caused the IETF to change the specification of PKINIT and Microsoft to release a security update for some Windows operating systems. We discovered this attack as part of an ongoing formal analysis of the Kerberos protocol suite, and we have formally verified several possible fixes to PKINITâincluding the one adopted by the IETFâthat prevent our attack as well as other authentication and secrecy properties of Kerberos with PKINIT.
