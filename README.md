# Intro-ML-Scientific-Paper-NLP-Project

Final Project Proposal
Marina Moore and Alex Huang
For our project, we are going to see what features impact the number of citations journal articles receive. We will look at features including sentiment analysis, length of the paper, and author’s university to see which features have the most impact and build a model to predict a paper’s success. Data about publications can be found in online sources including Science Direct and Google’s Search Analytics. To analyze the data we will use the sentiment analysis available here:  https://github.com/cjhutto/vaderSentiment, as well as machine learning models learned in class.
